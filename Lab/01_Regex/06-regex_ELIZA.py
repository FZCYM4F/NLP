### Optional Task 6 - ELIZA
# 
# ELIZA was an early natural language processing computer program created in 1964 (the year I was born) at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and created to demonstrate superficial communication techniques (OMG - it's like we're twins).
# 
# Eliza simulated conversation by using a "pattern matching" and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program. Famously ELIZA simulated a style of psychotherapist, well-known for simply parroting back at patients what they had just said, and used rules to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots and one of the first programs capable of attempting the Turing test.
# 
# You should implement an ELIZA-like conversational program, using substitutions such as those described on page 11 in the text book.
