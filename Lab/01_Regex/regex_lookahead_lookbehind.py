# TASK 3:
# Use the lookaround capabilities to match the following (see the lookaround slide in lecture 3 as a start)
#    a password with at least 6 characters, containing 2 upper case letters, two digits and two punctuation marks
#    the above password, but it can't start with AB, ab, 01 or 12 to trap the really obvious abcd... and 1234... passwords
#    separate out the different components of a camelCase word (e.g. getElementById -> [get, Element, by, Id]) -- Hint: identify each location where the previous character is lowercase and the next character is uppercase
#


# Determine which Python libraries you must import
# import ... 

# Write your code here

#
# (LAB SIGNOFF) show screen shot of the regex and results
