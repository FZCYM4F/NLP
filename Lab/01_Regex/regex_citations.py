## Optional Task 5 - citations
#
# The file [thesis.txt](https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3225/labs/citations-thesis.txt) contains the text of a PhD thesis. The examiner wants to know how many papers the student has cited, and of those, how many are “recent” (i.e. from the last decade).
# The bibliographic style used means that citations appear in the text with the basic form (surnames year), and you can see examples of this as they appear in the PDF <img src="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3225/labs/citations-sample.png" width="400">
#
# Write regular expressions to extract the list of citations from the thesis, answering the examiner's questions above.
