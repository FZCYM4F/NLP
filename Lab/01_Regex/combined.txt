Although the death rate from Covid-19 in the UK has fallen from its peak, there continue to be hundreds of deaths from the virus every week. The victims are young and old, and include people with underlying medical conditions and others without. Here are the stories of six people who died of the coronavirus in June, including frontline healthcare workers, a taxi driver and an 11-year-old child.  Richzeal Albufera, 45    Albufera, a biomedical scientist who worked in the laboratories at Castle Hill hospital in Cottingham, near Hull, died on 9 June. He had joined the hospital trust in April 2005. Staff there held a minute’s silence for him.  The chief executive of Hull University teaching hospitals NHS trust, Chris Long,  said : “We extend our deepest sympathies to Richzeal’s family, friends and all who loved him. We share their grief at the loss of such a wonderful life. Richzeal had already given so much to the NHS and had so much more to give.”  A fund set up to repatriate Albufera’s body to his family in the Philippines raised £10,000 in 11 days. His wife, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “I just want to say a big thank you to everyone for their love and support during this difficult time. It truly shows how much Rich was very loved by all.”  Brian Lennox, 84  Lennox was a well-known face in Chaddesden, Derby, where he ran two hardware stores from the 1950s until his retirement. He had been suffering from Parkinson’s in his later years, and he died on 20 June with coronavirus.  His widow, Brenda,  said : “Brian was a lovely, lovely man. People used to call him the ‘gentle gentleman’. He would do anything for anybody. I remember one Christmas Day we had a knock on the door and it was a lady who said her cooker broke. What did Brian do? He went in and fixed it. That was the type of man he was.”  Fabiana Zoppelli, 11  
Fabiana Zoppelli    Fabiana, from Oldham, died aged 11 at Royal Manchester children’s hospital on Sunday 7 June. She was reported to have shown few symptoms of Covid-19 before becoming seriously ill.  She was a pupil at Corpus Christi RC primary school, which  said in a statement : “She was an amazing girl. Fabiana enriched both our school and the whole community with her great enthusiasm and love for life. She was a friend to everyone and tried her best in everything she did.  “She trained with the school football team, read with confidence in assembly, visited Paris with her friends, created amazing artwork and had a smile that lit up every room she entered. Let us be thankful that we spent time with her and pray that her family feel supported at this time.”  Suliman Khan  
Suliman Khan    Khan, a well-known taxi driver in Bury, died on 8 June. Bury Private Hire Drivers Association provided a physically distanced guard of honour at his funeral, and  dozens of people lined the streets  leading to Bury cemetery to pay tribute to him.  The local MP James Daly offered his condolences to Khan’s family, saying: “He worked tirelessly as a taxi driver and was a familiar face in the local community, held in high affection. He was always lending a hand to others and reaching out to them when they were in need. He was an extremely caring and kind man.”  Chinedu Ekwunife, 35  
Chinedu Ekwunife    Chinedu Ekwunife died at Ipswich hospital on 14 June, shortly after his wife, Lotachi, discovered she was pregnant with their second child.  A  fundraising page  to support Ekwunife’s widow says he battled Covid-19 in intensive care for more than two months, adding: “Chinedu was a great fighter and did everything possible to stay alive for his young family but God had his own plans for him.”  Born in Nigeria, he studied at Southampton University and became a software engineer. He leaves behind his wife and a daughter aged two.  Rizal Manalo, 51  
Rizal Manalo    Manalo, a father of two, worked at Glan Clwyd hospital in Denbighshire and was treated at the hospital’s critical care unit before his death on 14 June. He was the seventh Filipino nurse to die in Wales after contracting Covid-19.  His wife, Agnes, said: “Zaldy is a hard-working person who loved his job dearly. He’s a good husband and a loving father to his children. He protected and cared for us.”  The hospital said Manalo was “well respected and loved by all his patients and colleagues”. Rab McEwan, the managing director, said: “Zaldy was a popular and respected member of the nursing team on ward five and we will miss him greatly. It’s always hard when someone who serves the NHS dies before their time.”   

The communities secretary,  Robert Jenrick , has insisted there is a prospect of some areas in England “de-escalating” from a higher to a lower tier of coronavirus measures before Christmas, despite scientists warning that the 16 December review will be too soon to make changes. 
Many Conservative MPs  reacted with anger  after the government announced that 99% of the population in England would be placed under the top two tightest levels of restriction – tiers 2 and 3 – when the nationwide lockdown ends next week. 
With suggestions that up to 70 Tory backbenchers are considering rebelling when the rules come to the House of Commons next Tuesday, Jenrick was keen to hold out the prospect of an early shift towards looser rules if compliance is high.

“There will be a review point every 14 days – so on the 16 or 17 December there will be an opportunity for those parts of the country where the judgment was finely balanced to potentially de-escalate from tier 3 to tier 2, and tier 2 to tier 1,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. 
He said the message to the public and MPs was that if they “abide by the rules, work hard at it, then there’s every reason to believe that at that review point or one shortly thereafter,” their area could be moved into a lower tier. 
That was a message Boris Johnson was keen to press home on Thursday night, insisting: “Your tier is not your destiny.” But Jenrick’s optimism contrasted with the view of Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Sage advisory committee, who told Today he didn’t expect enough data to have emerged by 16 December. 
“I think that is quite an early time to be able to see what the effect has been,” he said. “For me I think that is quite an early review stage. I can’t imagine there will be huge changes at that point just simply because I don’t think we will have accumulated much data by then.” 
Jenrick rejected that, insisting: “We do think the review point will be meaningful.” 
list of areas in each tier 
The government has promised to publish a detailed analysis of the impact of the restrictions before next week’s vote, in an attempt to convince wavering MPs. The restrictions are highly likely to pass, but the prime minister may need the support of Labour if enough of his own backbenchers rebel. 
Labour has not yet said how its MPs will vote. Keir Starmer is expected to receive a briefing from government scientific advisers on Monday before making a final decision. 
Some MPs have complained that their areas are facing a tougher regime from 2 December onwards than they were under before the four-week national shutdown began this month. 
Echoing the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, at Thursday’s Downing Street press conference, Jenrick conceded that this was because the previous tiered system was not doing enough to bring the virus under control. 
“We learned from the tiered system that was in place before the national measures, we took advice from Sage and the chief medical officer, and designed tiers that we thought were sufficiently robust that they could help to steer the country through until the vaccine programme rollout starts to take effect,” he said. 
He defended the fact that in most cases the tiers have been applied across entire counties, rather than at a smaller scale. Seven Kent MPs have written to the prime minister to complain that the county is being placed in the toughest measures despite cases in some areas remaining relatively low. 
Jenrick said future reviews would look at each local authority area separately. But he stressed: “You do have to balance that up against having too small a unit of geography, and not taking into account things like where are the hospitals that people share, where do they go to work, to shop, for leisure activities. 
“And we have seen in the past that sometimes when we’ve taken that approach, when we’ve hived out a particular place and put it in a lower tier than its surroundings, all that happens is that the rate of infection rapidly catches up in that place – and then that place either has to join that tier or even go higher.” He cited Nottinghamshire and the West Midlands as examples. 

An artist and children’s author was the victim of a shooting in a quiet Hampshire village in which the suspect fled on a motorcycle before crashing in a police chase and dying.  James Nash, who is also a parish councillor, suffered critical head injuries. Police are continuing to investigate the motive for the attack.    The shooting took place in the village of Upper Enham on Wednesday afternoon, where Nash, 42, and his wife, Sarah, a specialist in satellite technology with a government agency, live in a cottage.  The shooting suspect is believed to have left the scene on foot before jumping on to a motorcycle. The 34-year-old crashed the bike three miles away during a police chase.  An address in the village of Enham Alamein, half a mile from Nash’s home, was searched as part of the investigation.

He would literally do anything for anyone.”  On his blog, Nash describes himself as “a naturalist, first and foremost devoted to the conservation of our wild world”. The author and illustrator’s books include The Winter Wild from 2016.  Phil North, leader of Test Valley borough council, sought to reassure residents, telling them officers were “confident” that the motorcyclist was the attacker.  He said: “I know this will be a very worrying time for the community, and until the police complete their investigations we won’t get a full understanding of the incident.”  A Hampshire police spokesperson said the force has made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).  The spokesperson said: “The man had been shot and sustained serious head injuries. He remains in a critical condition in Southampton general hospital.  “A 40-year-old woman was also assaulted during this incident and sustained minor injuries.  “The motorcyclist, a 34-year-old man, died at the scene. Detectives are continuing to investigate the circumstances of these incidents. Detectives do not believe there are any outstanding suspects in this investigation.”  The Nashes’ house is on a quiet country lane next to the  Enham Trust , a charity providing support and care for the vulnerable and disabled.  A spokeswoman for the trust said: “We are saddened by the events that took place yesterday afternoon, and our thoughts are with the individual affected.  “This is of course a worrying time for the community and we are supporting residents within the village, but can confirm that nobody supported by the Trust or staff were involved.”   

Seven stowaways have been detained after the Special Boat Service stormed a Liberian-registered tanker off the Isle of Wight which they are suspected of attempting to hijack. 
The special forces responded to a request for help from Hampshire police in the early evening on Sunday, gaining control of the Nave Andromeda vessel in nine minutes after it was feared the crew was no longer fully in charge. 
“Armed forces have gained control of the ship and seven individuals have been detained. Police investigations will now continue. Initial reports confirm the crew are safe and well,” the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said in a statement. 
The 228-metre tanker had been expected to dock in  Southampton  on Sunday to pick up a cargo of petrol, but its course in the Channel became erratic, prompting calls for an intervention as it passed the south-east edge of the Isle of Wight. 
The SBS, based in nearby Poole, Dorset, used two  Royal Navy  Merlin and two navy Wildcat helicopters to take control of the tanker, which had sailed to the UK from Nigeria. Typically, 16 people fast-roping down from the helicopters would be used to take control of a ship.

Hampshire police said all 22 crew members of the Nave Andromeda were safe and well and officers were investigating. The force said: “At 10.04am today concerns were raised to police for the welfare of crew onboard the vessel, which was situated approximately six miles off the coast of Bembridge. 
“The vessel had been travelling in the direction of Southampton, having sailed from Lagos in Nigeria. It was reported that a number of stowaways were onboard, and they had made threats towards the crew. 
“Following a multi-agency response by police, with support from the military and other emergency service partners, seven people were detained by police.”  
The ship’s operator, Navios Tankers Management, said the stowaways “illegally boarded” the Liberian-flagged tanker in Lagos. 
A statement from the company said the master of the ship had become “concerned for the safety of the crew due to the increasingly hostile behaviour of the stowaways”.  
The company thanked the UK authorities in the operation “for their timely and professional response”. 
“Navios would also like to pay tribute to the master of the Nave Andromeda for his exemplary response and calmness and to all the crew for their fortitude in a difficult situation.” 
The vessel left Lagos on 6 October.  Lloyd’s List, the shipping newspaper , said it believed seven stowaways had boarded in Nigeria. Their presence had been discovered but they became violent when the crew attempted to lock them in a cabin. 
Naval insiders were relieved to have concluded the incident relatively quickly once the police asked for help. “This was happening pretty much in the Royal Navy’s backyard. I think they were keen to show they could put a stop to it,” a naval source said. 
The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, authorised armed forces personnel to board the ship in the Channel in response to a police request, the MoD said. 
Wallace said: “I commend the hard work of the armed forces and police to protect lives and secure the ship. In dark skies, and worsening weather, we should all be grateful for our brave personnel. People are safe tonight thanks to their efforts.”  
Tobias Ellwood, the chairman of the Commons defence committee, said the boarding of the tanker by British armed forces was a “good outcome”. “Seven stowaways onboard taking over a ship or causing the ship not to be in full command would have triggered a multi-agency alarm and then well-rehearsed classified protocols were put into action,” he told the BBC. 
“Initially, it didn’t look like this was terrorist-related nor involving WMD, but the erratic behaviour [of the ship] was concerning. The safety of the crew was important, as is indeed any unauthorised movement towards the coast. I am pleased to see that swift action has been taken.”

The Nave Andromeda is understood to be managed by Inchcape and owned by Greek operator Navios Maritime Holdings. The vessel was reported to have made two stops on its voyage, anchoring off the Canary Islands and off the French coast just south of Saint-Nazaire in Brittany. 
Police as well as Maritime and Coastguard Agency staff initially dealt with the incident. It comes after a summer in which the number of migrants crossing the Channel  has rapidly increased . According to a PA Media analysis, 7,000 migrants had arrived in the UK in small boats this year by the end of September – more than three times the number of arrivals by the same route in the whole of 2019.  

Police and social workers missed chances to protect a 13-year-old girl who was stabbed to death by a man after she threatened to reveal he had been sexually abusing her for more than a year, an independent review has found.  Social workers did not take effective action even after Lucy McHugh’s school flagged up their concerns that she had an older boyfriend who could be sexually exploiting her, the review concluded.    The review, overseen by the  Southampton Safeguarding Children Partnership , also found that police ought to have delved deeper when they learned that Lucy’s killer, Stephen Nicholson, 26, who had a history of violence, was tattooing children.  Nicholson, a care worker and lodger at the teenager’s home in Southampton,  was jailed for at least 33 years  for murdering Lucy. He lured her into woods near her home in Hampshire in July 2018 and stabbed her 27 times before hiding the weapon and trying to burn the clothes he had been wearing.  His trial at Winchester crown court heard that  Lucy’s school had raised concerns  that she was spending time unsupervised with an older man. The trial judge, Mrs Justice May, questioned why social services had not intervened.  The review found that agencies including children’s social care were aware of Nicholson’s criminal history. A “learning report” produced by the reviewers said the concerns correctly raised by her school did not progress further than the “front door” to the Multi Agency Safeguarding Hub.  The report said this “resulted in no multi-agency sharing of information held by police, the school and children’s social care.”  It added: “The referrals needed to be treated as one of child protection. If this had happened, a strategy discussion could have been convened concerning the risk this man posed. This did not happen and was a missed opportunity.”  The report said a lack of “professional curiosity” was a frequent theme emerging in such cases. It said in this instance there was “a lack of further investigation by police” when Nicholson came to their attention before Lucy’s death, “not least when it became known he was tattooing underage young people”.  It added: “By not following up on the concerns expressed about this man, an opportunity was missed to consider the risks he presented to [Lucy] and other young people.”  Of Nicholson, it said: “He was well known and appeared to be well liked and trusted in the local community. This man was, however, also well known to police, and children’s social care did have knowledge of elements of his background. Before being sentenced to life imprisonment, the perpetrator had numerous previous convictions, which included theft, battery, criminal damage, domestic violence and possession of cannabis.”  The report acknowledged that as a result of Lucy’s murder, “a number of partner agencies have changed procedures to enhance the way in which children are safeguarded”.  Supt Kelly Whiting, Hampshire police’s district commander for Southampton, said the force was “‘identifying improvements”, adding: “We are already developing a trauma informed approach to dealing with all incidents involving children.”  Rob Henderson, Southampton city council’s executive director for wellbeing (children and learning), said: “On behalf of the council I would like to apologise to the victim’s family, friends, and all who knew her, for the council’s shortcomings identified in the report. We have already made changes in a number of the areas highlighted.”  Nobody at the city council has been disciplined over the case. A spokesperson said: “Our focus has been on learning and changing the way we operate when dealing with highly complex cases such as this.”  Hampshire police said no disciplinary action had been taken.   

The UK could see record-breaking temperatures on Friday, with forecasters saying it could be the hottest day of the year. People are being warned to look out for older people, young children and those with underlying health conditions, as the UK prepares for the heatwave to continue through the weekend. 
The Met Office issued the amber heat health warning, the second-highest available, on Thursday as it warned people to look out for each other and drink plenty of fluids, while avoiding excessive quantities of alcohol, to deal with temperatures that could rise as high as 38C (100F) in some places. 
“Although much of the UK can expect a spell of warm and sunny weather lasting into early next week, it’s going to turn very hot for parts of England and  Wales  with temperatures widely reaching above 30C on Friday, Saturday and Sunday,” said the Met office’s chief meteorologist, Dan Suri.

“Friday is likely to be the hottest day with temperatures of 36C to 37C in parts of east and south-east England. It’s possible temperatures could reach similar levels on Saturday, before falling slightly on Sunday. 
“There’s also a small chance temperatures could reach close to 38C in one or two spots in the south-east on Friday, but this will partly depend on the chance of cloud spreading in from the south-west during the afternoon. Along with hot weather by day, it will stay warm and humid overnight with temperatures remaining in the high teens and low 20s celsius.” 
Forecasters are advising people to “close curtains on rooms that face the sun to keep indoor spaces cooler and remember it may be cooler outdoors than indoors”. 
The RNLI urged families  heading to the beach  to be aware of potential dangers. 
Last week, on 31 July, the UK recorded the hottest day of the year so far and the third-warmest on record, with the mercury rising to 37.8C (100.04F) at Heathrow airport. The coastguard reported its busiest day for more than four years as it dealt with more than 300 incidents. 
Ahead of this week’s sunny spell, Gareth Morrison, RNLI’s head of water safety, said: “Our coastline is a fantastic place to spend time together as a family, especially when the sun is out and it’s hot. 
“But there are also plenty of potential dangers, especially for those who aren’t fully aware of their surroundings and may be visiting a particular beach for the first time. We are advising everyone planning a visit to a beach or the coast to follow [the] beach safety advice.” 

Medieval clergymen are usually thought of as pretty tough sorts but an 800-year-old document that has gone on display at Salisbury cathedral suggests the great church’s early leaders were not keen on blustery weather and may have been more than a little intimidated by their neighbours. 
The document, a papal bull from the 13th-century head of the Catholic church, Honorius III, gave permission for the cathedral to be moved from its site at  Old Sarum  on the outskirts of modern Salisbury to its sheltered modern position. 
Pope Honorius stepped in after disgruntled clergy in Salisbury complained their services were being drowned out by the blustery conditions at Old Sarum. 
Map 
They were also unhappy with the leaky cathedral roof and complained of bullying by soldiers stationed at Old Sarum castle. They even claimed that “the faithful” were unable to visit the “mother church” because the castle guards turned them away from the site on security grounds. 
As part of celebrations to mark  800 years since the foundation stones were laid  at the present site, the papal bull – written in Latin – is being exhibited at the cathedral. 
The earlier Salisbury cathedral was created after the Council of London decreed in 1075 that the bishop’s seat should move from Sherborne in Dorset to Old Sarum. But by the 13th century the clergy were enduring a fractious relationship with the garrison at Old Sarum castle. 
In the papal bull, dated 29 March 1218, the pope wrote: “The cathedral is subject to so much inconvenience and oppression, that you cannot live there without great danger to life and limb. 
“For as it is situated on a considerable eminence it is continually buffeted by the winds, so that you can scarcely hear each other speak while you are celebrating the divine offices and the place is so damp that those who live there are subject to constant illnesses. 
“The population is scarcely sufficient to provide for repairs to the roof of the church, which are constantly damaged by storms. They are obliged to buy water at as great a price as would elsewhere be sufficient to buy the common drink of the country, nor can they have access to it without the permission of the castle guard.” 
The original cathedral was abandoned and the new, improved version completed in 1258. The famous spire was added in the early 1300s while up on the windy hill, the castle remained an administrative centre. 
The papal bull is bound into The Register of St Osmund, which contains documents from the cathedral’s earliest history including the foundation charter for the first cathedral and a description of the laying of the present cathedral’s foundation stones on 28 April 1220. 
It is on display along with other items from the cathedral archive and library. Originally conceived to celebrate the cathedral’s 800th birthday in April, the exhibition has been delayed until now because of the Covid-19 crisis. 
Emily Naish, the Salisbury Cathedral archivist, said: “These documents give us an insight into the life of our medieval ancestors who worked and worshipped here, forming a unique link between the past and the present. The cathedral’s 800th anniversary is a marvellous opportunity for us to display some of the greatest treasures from our collections.” 
Also being exhibited is “an indulgence” issued by Archbishop Stephen Langton around the time building commenced on the cathedral’s present site. It grants forgiveness to anyone who contributed towards the cost of construction. Indulgences were a common way to raise funds in medieval times. 
Another spectacular exhibit is a six-metre-long scroll detailing the annual food consumption of the cathedral’s canon treasurer and household in the 13th century. 
He and his staff, it turns out, were fond of beef, mutton and pork. Friday was fish day, with a selection of herring, plaice and ling on offer, while for special feasts he tucked into spiced sauces, pies and pasties flour for fritters. 
The canon treasurer’s clerk, known only as Colin, was responsible for keeping the accounts. 
Commenting on his medieval predecessor’s groceries, the current canon treasurer, Robert Titley, said: “I suspect our supermarket receipts for a year, laid end to end, would be even longer than my namesake’s parchment. And we too enjoy the skills of someone called Colin – he helps us with the garden.” 

A British pilot is to be prosecuted in connection with the plane crash in which the Argentinian professional footballer Emiliano Sala died. 
The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)  revealed on Thursday it had charged David Henderson, 66, with two offences relating to the accident over the Channel last year.  
Striker Sala, 28, was being flown from Nantes in France to his new club, Cardiff City, on 21 January 2019 when the light aircraft being piloted by David Ibbotson, 59, from Lincolnshire, plunged into the sea near Guernsey. Sala’s body was recovered from the seabed 68 metres down but Ibbotson’s body has not been found. 
The CAA said it has charged Henderson, who allegedly arranged the flight, with two offences under the Air Navigation Order (2016). 
He is accused of acting in a “reckless/negligent” manner, and being involved in the commercial use of the plane involved in the crash. 
Richard Stephenson, the CAA communications director, said: “The UK Civil Aviation Authority has commenced a prosecution of David Henderson for offences associated with the fatal light aircraft accident over the English Channel in January 2019.” 
Henderson,      who is from north-east England, is due to appear at Cardiff crown court on 26 October. 
The prosecution means a full inquest is not expected to take place until 2022. 
During a pre-inquest review on the case in Bournemouth, Keith Morton QC, representing the CAA, said: “On 9 September 2020, the CAA issued two summonses against David Henderson for offences under the Air Navigation Order. 
“One, endangering aircraft, relates to two flights including the return flight on 21 January 2019, that ended in the accident. A separate offence relates to the licensing of that particular flight on 21 January.” He said Henderson had appeared at Cardiff magistrates and denied the charges. 
Dorset coroner Rachael Griffin said it would be in the “interest of justice” not to go ahead with the inquest until criminal proceedings against Henderson had ended. 
Matthew Reeve, representing Sala’s family, said they opposed the delay. He said: “There is a significant public interest to this inquest and delays should be avoided in the interest of public safety. 
“There has already been a delay of two years and it is the wish of the family that this inquest hearing go on as planned. One does not have to imagine the impact on the family of further delay.” 
Speaking afterwards, Daniel Machover of law firm Hickman _ Rose, which is representing the footballer’s mother, Mercedes Taffarel, said she was disappointed. 
He said: “His mother remains desperate to know the full truth about how this could have been allowed to happen, and urges the CAA to proceed with its criminal prosecution as swiftly as possible, so an inquest can be held to establish this, and that similar deaths are prevented.” 
A report on the crash by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch found that neither Ibbotson nor the plane were licensed for the flight to operate commercially, but evidence showed he was to be paid a fee. 
Unlicensed charter flight operations – known as grey charters – generally incur lower operating costs. 
The inquest hearing was watched on video link by Ibbotson’s wife, Nora, with legal representatives for Cardiff City and the CAA in attendance. The inquest was adjourned until 15 December. 

Retailers and food and drinks companies have called for MPs to launch an urgent inquiry into disruption at British ports, with delays to goods deliveries possibly set to last for months.  The delays mean consumers may have to pay higher Christmas prices and companies may be unable to build up stockpiles of goods to see them through  Brexit  disruption, the retail and food and drinks industry warned, in a letter to the chairs of parliament’s transport and international trade committees.    The cost of importing goods has  rocketed in recent weeks  after the pandemic knocked demand and production around the world out of sync. Shipping executives have reported shortages of containers in China,  pushing up prices  just as British companies build up Brexit stockpiles.  UK ports such as Felixstowe and Southampton have struggled with the increased workload, causing delays in deliveries and even prompting some ships to avoid British ports altogether and opt for Rotterdam or Zeebrugge. The blockages have contributed to  miles-long queues of lorries  at Dover and Folkestone.  Retailers ranging from  Ikea  to The Entertainer and AO.com have all reported stocks being held up at ports. The Honda car plant in Swindon was forced to halt production for two days last week after it ran short of imported parts. On Wednesday, Dixons said it was also experiencing port delays, though problems were not yet filtering through to stores. 
Any port in a perfect storm: UK container trade is grinding to a halt  
Read more        The ports industry lobby group Logistics UK said ports were under substantial pressure and added: “High volumes do remain, and delays could persist for some months.”  Zoe McLernon of Logistics UK said: “Covid-19 has caused unprecedented volatility in the supply chain. Add to this the increased seasonal pressures caused by the Christmas retail market, and businesses stocking up ahead of the introduction of customs controls at the end of the transition period, and the pressure on the supply chain is immense.”  She added: “Clarity over our future relationship with the EU is vital and we continue to push for confirmation of a free trade agreement.”  The government last month relaxed the enforcement of limits on lorry drivers’ hours after the British Retail Consortium requested help. However, the BRC and the Food and Drink Federation warned that some delays were inevitable. The end of the Brexit transition period on 1 January will put the ports under even greater pressure, they said.  Helen Dickinson, the BRC chief executive, said the problems must be addressed urgently, and that the promise of an inquiry could help improve scrutiny.  However, an inquiry would be unlikely to address the ports problems before the new year because the transport and international trade committees do not meet until 6 January. The transport committee previously heard evidence on the ports in October.  “The lead-up to Christmas is the most important time of year for retailers,” said Dickinson. “After a tremendously challenging 2020, many firms’ cashflows are under severe pressure, and so businesses are in no position to absorb these additional shipping costs.  “As a result, consumers will pay the final price. Christmas orders could be delayed, and retailers might be left with no option but to increase product prices.”  
Guardian business email sign-up    The disruption has affected all companies which rely on the steady supply of goods, including  Honda,   Ikea  and  the construction industry .  The latest purchasing managers’ index, published by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, showed 45% of companies were struggling to cope with longer delivery times from suppliers. Only 2% reported an improvement on November.  Manufacturers reported a  faster increase in delays on shipments  than at any point in the last two decades barring the start of the pandemic, the survey showed.   

The government is to press ahead with a £27bn programme of roadbuilding over the next five years, the chancellor has confirmed, with a wider infrastructure strategy to be unveiled  at a later date . Rishi Sunak billed the move as “the largest ever investment in English strategic roads”, and pledged additional funding of £500m a year to top up a pothole fund.  The road investment strategy will see all vehicle excise duty hypothecated for roads. The policy was first  announced by George Osborne in 2015  and the sum pledged on Wednesday was about £2.1bn higher than the funds earmarked by the Treasury last autumn.    Sunak said the £27.4bn from 2020-25 would “pay for work on over 20 connections to ports and airports, over 100 junctions, 4,000 miles of road”.  Among the schemes he promised to deliver was  the controversial work  to expand  the A303 at Stonehenge , described as catastrophic by environmentalists and archaeologists. Sunak said it was “one of those totemic projects symbolising delay and obstruction”.  He added: “Governments have been trying to fix it since the 1980s. Every year, millions of cars crawl along it in traffic, ruining the backdrop to one of our most important historic landmarks. The A303 – this government’s going to get it done.”  Other road development schemes that he pledged would go ahead include the  Lower Thames Crossing  between Kent and Essex, the A46 Newark bypass in the Midlands, and the Pant-Llanymynech bypass along the Welsh border route of the A483, as well as work on “unclogging Manchester’s arteries”.  The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the first priority in the updated road strategy would be to fix the existing strategic roads rather than build new ones. He said: “Only where existing roads are simply not up to the job the country asks of them are we asking Highways England to develop wider, realigned or, in a few cases, wholly new roads to keep people and goods moving.”  The additional £500m a year to fill potholes will come on top of around £1bn already pledged for annual repairs, according to the Treasury. Sunak said the funding would fill 50 million potholes.  Darren Shirley, chief executive of Campaign for Better Transport, said the money was “welcome [but] long overdue”. But motoring groups queried whether it would be enough, with evident decline after an annual spend of £5bn on Britain’s local roads during the past decade. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said that while potholes were the “poster child” for maintenance, road bridges also needed billions for repair. “The evidence of motorists’ eyes is that the already poor state of the roads has worsened significantly following the recent flooding and storms.”  Others warned that the roadbuilding was incompatible with climate commitments. Prof Greg Marsden, of the Institute for Transport Studies at the University of Leeds, said there should be a moratorium on new road construction pending the take-up of electric vehicles, adding: “The focus on shovel-ready infrastructure expansion on the roads will, regrettably, simply dig us a bigger climate hole to get out of.”  Sunak said that roadbuilding would be part of a broader national infrastructure strategy, the publication of which has now been delayed until later this year. He said that would involve capital investment of more than £600bn over the parliament. According to the Treasury, that includes spending on rail, communications, schools, hospitals and power networks.  Money announced in the budget to improve communications infrastructure includes £5bn for gigabit-speed broadband in rural areas of the UK, and £510m of new investment in the shared rural mobile phone network. Sunak said this meant 4G coverage would reach 95% of the country by 2025.  Another £1bn was allocated from an existing Transforming Cities fund to improve bus and cycling infrastructure in 12 cities, including Stoke, Preston, Derby, Nottingham and Southampton. Sunak also said West Yorkshire would share in £4.2bn in funding settlements for eight mayoral combined authorities, allowing them to help create London-style integrated transport. Shirley said the money would “allow these areas to develop transport solutions that work for local communities and provide affordable, sustainable public transport for millions of people”.  Sunak disappointed northern transport leaders by reaffirming support for a Manchester-Leeds rail link and HS2, but not offering any more firm funding towards the Northern Powerhouse vision, although another £20m was given to develop plans for a proposed Midlands rail hub.  The chancellor also indicated that the Treasury would review its Green Book rules, calculating the cost and benefit of infrastructure investment, which have been criticised for making schemes appear less beneficial outside the south.   

A Chelsea football fan was jailed for two years and eight months for committing an aggravated assault on the Guardian columnist Owen Jones with a “karate kick to his lower back”, motivated by hostility to the writer’s leftwing and LGBT politics.  James Healy, 40, from Portsmouth, was sentenced at Snaresbrook crown court for “a frenzied and wholly unprovoked attack” last August that took place in the street late at night after Jones had been out celebrating his birthday.    Recorder Anne Studd, the presiding judge, said there were “very significant aggravating factors” as she handed down the sentence to Healy at the high end of the range available.  The judge described Healy as “a man holding extreme rightwing opinions who attacked a victim who did no more than hold opinions on which the defendant did not agree”.  
The judge described James Healy, pictured, as ‘a man holding extreme rightwing opinions’.  Photograph: Central News   Two other men, Liam Tracey, 35, from Camden, London, and Charlie Ambrose, 31, from Brighton, were also sentenced for their part in the assault.  Tracey and Ambrose received an eight-month sentence, suspended for two years. Both had pleaded guilty last December although the conclusion of the case was delayed for several months due to the coronavirus crisis.  The court heard how Jones was attacked from behind by Healy at 2am outside the Lexington pub in King’s Cross, north London, having recognised the journalist and commentator in the pub earlier in the evening.  Jones was knocked to the ground and injured after being struck, and was “spared further blows only by the actions of the friends who were with him”, Studd said as she read out her judgment. A general fight then broke out involving Healy and the other two defendants.  In a victim impact statement, Jones said that while the injuries he sustained healed rapidly, there had been a longer lasting psychological impact. Despite previously being on the receiving end of online abuse, it was the first time he had been subject to a physical attack.  Philip McGhee, prosecuting, said Jones believed it was “harder to ignore online threats now” and that “he no longer feels he can walk alone, and will take taxis even for short distances as on account of this attack he feels at risk”.  The three men were not detained in the immediate aftermath of the fight in the street, but the court heard that they were arrested after they were recognised from CCTV footage by officers familiar with Chelsea supporters known to police.  Healy had at least nine convictions relating to football hooliganism stretching back to 1998. A search of his property after his arrest revealed a collection of far-right hooligan memorabilia, loosely connected with the Chelsea Youth Firm.  McGhee, prosecuting, said Healy possessed “a greeting card, which bore Nazi far-right extremist terror symbols, including those associated with the far-right Combat 18 group, one of whose tenets is ‘kill all queers’”.  Also discovered was a Nazi SS flag bearing a “totenkopf” death’s head skull symbol plus “a number of pins of badges”, including a circular pin badge with the “lead the way” and “whatever it takes” motto of Combat 18 and a badge that said “Chelsea FC no asylum seekers”.  Healy had pleaded guilty to the charges of actual body harm and affray but a special fact-finding hearing in January ruled that the “wholly unprovoked assault” was aggravated because Jones had been targeted because of his pro-LGBT and leftwing political views. Healy was also sentenced for 10 months for affray, served concurrently.  The judge concluded Jones had been identified in the pub by Healy or one of his friends earlier in the evening and that they had identified him as a target for attack.  CCTV footage showed Healy appearing to motion to friends outside the pub that Jones was leaving – and that he then followed him to launch “a running kick” on Jones in the small hours.  After the sentencing, Jones said: “Prison isn’t a solution to far right extremism: it’s a political problem which can’t be magicked away by custodial sentences. But if any good comes of this case, it’s to focus attention on a far-right threat which poses a violent threat to minorities and the left, including to those who have suffered far more than me”.  A Guardian spokesperson said: “We are pleased that the police and courts have now dealt with those responsible for this terrible attack. Assaults on journalists or political activists have no place in a decent society.”   

_A string of luxury properties, including a £17m home near  Harrods , were acquired by the children of Azerbaijan’s former security chief, an investigation has revealed. 
Eldar Mahmudov was dismissed as national security minister by a presidential order in 2015. No official explanation was given for his removal. 
Now, caches of customer files hacked from the Cayman National Bank (Isle of Man) Ltd (CNBIOM) in November 2019, and subsequently published online, reveal that Mahmudov’s family has built up an estimated €100m business and property empire. 
Almost all of its assets were acquired through companies linked to Mahmudov’s son, Anar, 36, and his daughter, Nargiz Mahmudova, 31. 
The files reveal that in June 2016 a compliance manager at CNBIOM drafted an internal memo about a network of “connected entities” linked to Britannia Group Ltd that were all Mahmudov companies. 
“I have serious concerns about this a/c [account] and overall relationship without even looking at the transactions,” the manager wrote._ 
The following month, the bank filed a disclosure with the Financial Intelligence Unit in the Isle of Man, citing the territory’s Proceeds of Crime Act 2008.

Between October 2014 and July 2015, the bank, based in the  Cayman Islands , noted Anar Mahmudov had made deposits worth almost £14m into Britannia Group Ltd’s accounts. 
A joint investigation of the leaked data by reporters from the  Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project  ,   Finance Uncovered  and Transparency International shows that, among the properties acquired by the siblings using the “connected entities” identified by CNBIOM, were two office blocks in Poole and Bournemouth, valued_at £13.5m. 
The investigation also reveals that Anar Mahmudov holds the deeds to a four-storey property in Pont Street, Knightsbridge, bought for £17.35m. 
Anar Mahmudov’s mother-in-law, Zamira Hajiyeva, was  famously found  to have_spent more than £16m in Harrods. Her husband,  Jahangir Hajiyev , the chairman of Azerbaijan’s state bank, was arrested for embezzlement in 2015 and later jailed. 
After Hajiyev was charged and Eldar Mahmudov dismissed, CNBIOM shut down the Mahmudov-linked accounts._“It is now important that there is full transparency and the source of wealth for these investments is investigated,” said Duncan Hame, Transparency International UK’s Director of Policy. 
Lawyers for Anar and Nargiz Mahmudov told Finance Uncovered that the family’s wealth can be traced back to an ancestor, Aslan Ashurov, who made his fortune in the 19th century. They said the siblings’ assets were all properly registered and accounted for and that Anar Mahmudov was a successful businessman in his own right. 
The cache of leaked documents included a letter explaining that Anar’s wealth was derived from his aunt, Elmira Mahmudova, who established an oil and construction firm in Baku. 
The investigation found that the Mahmudovs also own_properties and companies in Majorca, Luxembourg and Lithuania.  
CNBIOM said in a statement that “it is conscious at all times of its responsibilities with regard to money laundering… and has always cooperated fully with the authorities in relation to suspicious transactions or criminal or regulatory investigations.” 
The Mahmudovs’ lawyer was approached by the  Observer  but did not respond.

China represents a strategic threat to Britain as its navy could reach the North Atlantic via the Arctic by a route opened up by global heating, the head of the  Royal Navy  has said. 
Adm Tony Radakin, the first sea lord, said an “increasingly assertive”  China  had the capability to reach waters north of the UK by using the emerging Northern Sea Route. 
“Climate change is a concern for all of us, but it is opening up new maritime trade routes across the top of the world, halving the transit time between Europe and Asia. And we sit at the gateway to those routes,” the navy chief said in a speech given from the new £3.1bn Prince of Wales aircraft carrier in Portsmouth on Thursday. 
“But when China sails its growing navy into the Atlantic, which way will it come – the long route or the short?” 
The navy says that the once icebound Northern Sea Route, which runs the length of Russia, has become passable to normal shipping during August, September and October without the need to use an icebreaker. 
Experts say it is at least 10-12 sailing days quicker than traditional routes via Singapore and the Suez canal, and its emergence has become a growing source of concern at senior levels of the navy. They fear China will work with the Kremlin to try to exploit it for trade and military purposes. 
Britain’s navy is increasingly being drawn into maritime conflict with China. In 2018 the then defence secretary, Gavin Williamson,  sent the HMS Albion  to sail close to manmade islands in the South China Sea that are claimed by Beijing, although they are more than 200 miles away from its mainland. China said the UK had undertaken “provocative actions” and aggressively asked the ship to move on. 
Northern Sea Route. 
Navy insiders argue that Britain has to face up to a long-term challenge from Beijing, which is gradually becoming a military as well as economic superpower – tying in with a growing belief in Washington that China and the US are in increasingly locked into a low-level conflict. 
The admiral’s warning comes at a time when the service is vying for resources as part of the integrated review of defence and foreign policy due to conclude in November, and with Anglo-Chinese relations at a low ebb after Beijing launched a national security crackdown in Hong Kong. 
The navy has been repeatedly criticised for overspending, and last year it was directly criticised by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief aide, for continuing to  “squander billions of pounds”  on two new aircraft carriers whose costs doubled to £6.2bn. 
China now boasts the world’s most powerful navy, with 350 ships and submarines, according to an  annual review  conducted by the Pentagon. The Royal Navy ranks 28th by number of ships, although it is one of only three navies to have a pair of aircraft carriers or more, along with China and the US. 
Britain intends to sail the first of the carriers, the Queen Elizabeth, to the Indo-Pacific next spring but will not clarify the exact route. There is speculation that it may be sent to the South China Sea in conjunction with US and Australian warships to assert the right of freedom of navigation. 
Chris Parry, a former rear admiral, said: “The Northern Sea Route is a major component of China’s Belt and Road initiative in its quest to dominate trade in and around Eurasia. The risk is that China, in cooperation with Russia, will seek to exclude others from the route by restrictive practices.” 

A police officer has been charged with murder following the death of a woman near Bournemouth.  Officers were called to the car park of the Horns Inn in Christchurch Road, West Parley, Dorset, on Saturday afternoon after the ambulance service reported two people needed medical assistance.    Claire Parry, 41, from Bournemouth, was taken to Royal Bournemouth hospital for treatment but died on Sunday morning.  Timothy Brehmer, 41, a constable with Dorset police, who was said to be known to the victim, was arrested at the scene of the incident and taken to Poole hospital for treatment to injuries to his arms. He was later released.  He was arrested on suspicion of murder following Parry’s death.  Brehmer was charged with murder on Monday and is due to appear at Poole magistrates court by remote link on Tuesday.  He was not on duty at the time of the incident, but Dorset police said due to his occupation and the seriousness of the charge, a referral has been made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct.  Mark Callaghan, the force’s assistant chief constable, said: “Detectives from our major crime investigation team are leading the investigation into this incident.  “We have kept the family of Mrs Parry updated throughout the investigation and family liaison officers continue to support them. Our thoughts remain with her family and friends at this very difficult time.  “Following inquiries into this incident, we have consulted with the Crown Prosecution Service, which has authorised a charge of murder.  “It is important to stress that it would be entirely inappropriate for Dorset Police to comment any further ahead of the court process. It is vital that the justice system is allowed to follow its course.”

Parents of children with serious illnesses are failing to bring them to hospital out of fear their youngsters will catch Covid-19, according to a leading doctor. 
Dr Sanjay Patel , a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases at Southampton children’s hospital, said fewer severely ill children were being brought to its emergency department with conditions such as appendicitis, dehydration and sepsis, PA Media reports. 
He said some parents were assuming that all illnesses were being caused by coronavirus or were not seeking healthcare due to fears over catching the virus. 
He has now helped develop  national guidance on children’s health  to enable parents to assess when they should be seeking help. 
It consists of a red, amber and green traffic light system advising parents of which symptoms require them to seek urgent medical advice and the options available to them. 
Patel said:  
These are extremely challenging and worrying times for families and I can’t stress how important it is to follow the government advice about social distancing in order to slow down the speed of Covid-19. 
However, I’m really worried there is a very real risk that some children with illnesses such as appendicitis, dehydration or even sepsis are not being brought to see healthcare professionals as quickly as they would be normally. 
He continued: “We know that the message about Covid-19 is so powerful and parents are putting most children’s illnesses down to this.  
“The other issue is that they are just too scared to bring their child to see a healthcare professional because they are worried that they might pick up Covid-19.”

A comment piece about the Nightingale hospital in East London published by HuffPost is being widely shared. The  article by an anonymous ITU doctor  raises concerns about whether the field hospital is fit for purpose.  
The doctor says: 
Critical care is not a specialty in which we can rapidly upskill people. I do not want to disparage those who’ve already put themselves forward; I admire their dedication to the public.  
However, the nature of critical care requires difficult decisions to be made, often backed by years of experience. It is not a matter of watching a few instructional videos or reviewing a cobbled-together management guide as many of my colleagues have been asked to do.  
These are well-meaning and helpful, but do not replace years of clinical experience.

Actor  Christopher Eccleston  has said he hopes the NHS will no longer be a “political football” following the coronavirus pandemic. 
The ex-Doctor Who star said there should be “no more threats to the NHS”. 
Eccleston told TV show Lorraine:  
I’m hoping now... that the world has changed, the NHS will no longer be a political football for any of the parties and that it is protected because it is the greatest expression of Britain we have. 
It’s our nation’s conscience and now it is saving our lives and a lot of people are doing it without protective equipment. 
Asked how he was coping with the lockdown, Eccleston said that keeping healthy was helping, but added he doesn’t know how he would handle it if he was “in a tower block without a back garden”. 
He told the ITV show: “Exercise has helped me. I’ve cut down on the booze ... because I’m thinking if I can protect my immune system ... my aim is to be able to handle it without going to hospital. If I can keep myself away from the NHS, if somebody older ... needs a bed they’d get the bed.”

Britain is at its best when faced with a crisis, the Duke of Cambridge has said, as he checked in on how small charities are coping during the coronavirus pandemic.  
William praised the community spirit that “comes rushing back” in times of adversity as he spoke to some of the first beneficiaries of National Emergencies Trust (NET) funding.

The future king has been appointed as the trust’s first patron, and video-called members of grassroots charities to discuss the challenges they are facing and how the emergency funding is helping them to support their communities.  
Speaking to a representative of Moorlands Community Charity, he praised the public’s response to the crisis.  
I think Britain is at its best, weirdly, when we’re in a crisis. We all pull together and that community spirit and that community feel comes rushing back quicker than anything else. 
The NET said £12.5m has been distributed since the emergency appeal was launched with William’s help last month.  
In footage of the latest royal video call to be released amid the pandemic, William gave a “virtual high five” to the Moorlands charity, passing on his good wishes for the “fantastic job” its members are doing.  
The organisation, which has seen a significant rise in referrals to the service since the outbreak of Covid-19, is delivering meals to isolated households and ensuring vital products such as baby powder and nappies - which were affected by panic-buying - are provided to those most in need.

Around 50m pints of beer could go to waste if pubs remain closed into the summer because of lockdown. 
Tom Stainer, chief executive of the Campaign for Real Ale (Camra), estimates the UK’s 39,000 pubs have, on average, 15 barrels in their cellar at any given time. 
Kegs usually contain either 11 or 9 gallons each, and the best before dates on pasteurised beer - including most lagers - is usually three to four months after delivery, while real ales and other unpasteurised beer can last 6-9 months.   
“It’s a very sad waste of all the work and talent that goes into producing great beer,” Stainer told the BBC. “People won’t get to drink it and all those resources have been used up for nothing.”  
Alcohol sales in supermarkets rose by 22% last month, after pubs, restaurants and bars were closed on 20 March.

The son of a doctor who died after contracting coronavirus, having previously raised concerns over the lack of protective equipment, said he was “so proud” of his father for holding the government accountable.  
Dr Abdul Mabud Chowdhury’s son, Intisar, told Good Morning Britain: “He really didn’t want to convey his own fears about his own life and the lives of his co-workers to me and my sister. 
“When he wrote that letter [about the lack of PPE] he was in such an ill state, a painful state, he was unable to vocally communicate with me, or my sister or my mother. 
“But he still made sure that on behalf of his co-workers and colleagues that he would hold the government accountable for not providing enough protection for NHS frontline workers and I am so proud of him for that.” 
Intisar went on to say that Priti Patel’s statement in a press conference that she was “sorry if people feel there have been failings” over PPE, was “not a real apology”. 
“There have been failings, and I’ve seen those failings happen,” he said. “The government aren’t on the frontline, our NHS workers are, so they need to make sure that our NHS workers are properly equipped to fight this disease and protect our society in general. 
“Those NHS workers then have their own families that they need to protect - this was my father’s message the whole time and I’m just trying to convey that.”

More than 100 coronavirus-related fines have been issued in three days in Northern Ireland, police said.  
Officers broke up barbecues and a small number of large house parties, assistant chief constable Alan Todd said.  
Some parents were also believed to have left their children to play at friends’ houses.  
Todd told the BBC’s Good Morning Ulster programme: “We engage with people, it is only when people won’t take the encouragement we end up having to enforce the matter.”  
A total of 107 fines were imposed in three days over the Easter period.  
House parties involved some dozen or more people, although some were bigger, Todd said.  
Police stepped up their patrols at coastal beauty spots over the weekend and said the majority of people complied with restrictions designed to limit spread of the virus.

The parents of a New Zealand nurse praised by the prime minister for the care she gave him have said they are “exceptionally proud” of their daughter.  
One of the nurses named by Boris Johnson in his video message yesterday as Jenny from Invercargill, on New Zealand’s South Island, has been identified as Jenny McGee.

Speaking to Television New Zealand, her mother, Caroline McGee, said: “It makes us feel exceptionally proud obviously.  
“But she has told us these things over the years and it doesn’t matter what patient she is looking after, this is what she does.” 
She added: “I just find it incredible that she, any nurses, can do this for 12 hours, sit and watch a patient and twiddle away with all the different knobs and things they do to keep their patients alive, it’s absolutely amazing.”  
Jenny’s father, Mike McGee, also said: “I think over the years she has always told us that her job is one-on-one nursing with very critically ill people and that means she’s there all the time for 12 hours.  
“So once we’d heard that Boris Johnson had gone into intensive care it was obvious that at some stage Jenny would possibly run into him and be giving him the same level of care that she would have given anybody else the week before or next week and we’re really proud of her.”  
Johnson, who said the “NHS has saved my life, no question” after spending seven nights in St Thomas’, was discharged at the weekend.

Lockdown measures to be reviewed this week 
A review of lockdown measures will take place later this week after the hospital coronavirus death toll rose above 10,000.  
Ministers have said they want to be sure the UK is past the peak of the outbreak before easing the restrictions, but 10 members of the cabinet are reportedly urging lockdown conditions to be eased amid concerns about the impact on the economy.  
The Times quoted an unnamed minister as saying it was important not to do “more damage”, and measures could be eased after another three weeks.  
Scientific advisers will meet on Tuesday ahead of the formal review of the strict physical distancing measures on Thursday, the deadline set out in law.  
The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who warned during his budget last month that the UK risks falling into recession as a result of disruption caused by coronavirus, has injected £14bn from the coronavirus emergency response fund into the NHS and local authorities.

Liverpool has a significantly higher death rate from Covid-19 than the rest of the UK, according to an  investigation by the Liverpool Echo . 
At the time of writing, more than 700 people have died in Merseyside’s hospitals – with many more sadly passing in the community. 
The death rate of Covid-19 patients at Liverpool’s main hospital trust is 22%, compared with the UK average of 13%. 
Liverpool is in the top three core cities in terms of its Covid-19 death rate – higher than even Birmingham which has of course been hit very badly by tragedy in this crisis. 
Essentially more people getting coronavirus and going into Liverpool’s hospitals with serious coronavirus are sadly not coming out.

Summary 
Here’s a round up of the latest on coronavirus in the UK: 
Government resists pressure to publish Sage membership  
Dominic Raab has said the government has no plans to publish the list of participants in the Sage committee of scientific experts, after the Guardian revealed that key meetings have been attended by Dominic Cummings. “We don’t release as a matter of practice the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence,” Raab said.  
Concerns that the public will be coerced into installing a new contact tracing app  
The campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to a contact tracing app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased. The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective. 
Boris Johnson says protecting public health is the priority  
Ahead of his return to work the prime minister has signalled that he against lifting the lockdown. Citing Cicero, Johnson told cabinet colleagues: “‘The health of the people should be the supreme law’.” Raab said the Johnson was “raring to go” back to work. 
Raab rejects setting out a timetable for easing the lockdown  
The foreign secretary has rejected calls for setting out the options for easing the lockdown saying this risked confusing the public. Raab said: “Until we can be confident, based on the scientific advice, that we’ll make sure-footed steps forward which will protect life but also preserve our way of life, frankly, it’s not responsible to start speculating about the individual measures.” He said it would be “unimaginable” to open schools without social distancing measures and said the resumption of amateur sport this summer would be “very difficult”. But professional sport “could be different,” he said.  
Raab warns against counting on an early vaccine  
Raab said a vaccine is “not likely to come to fruition this year”. He confirmed the government is considering ordering millions of antibody tests to gauge how many people have had the virus, but he cautioned that there was still doubt about the reliability of the tests.  
Labour calls for investigation into National Shielding Helpline   
Labour has called for an investigation into reports that call handlers at the privately run National Shielding Helpline have mocked and fobbed off callers during the coronavirus crisis. The shadow communities secretary, Steve Reed, said: “These reports are extremely distressing. A full investigation must be launched immediately. If vulnerable people who call the helpline are not getting the support they need, the programme must be overhauled.”

“We don’t release as a matter of practice the names of all the members of Sage because the risk of them being subject to pressure, undue influence,” the first minister and foreign secretary said on Sunday. 
He rejected the idea there had been a “lack of transparency” from the government over the group’s work. 
“We’ve had the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, along with politicians like me standing up on a daily basis answering the questions, setting out their advice and making sure that we communicate as clearly as possible to the public what that advice is,” he said. 
Some senior Conservatives, including the former cabinet minister David Davis, have joined calls for more information to be published about the committee’s deliberations. 
We will not publish who is on scientific advisory group, says Raab

Liberty: _public should not be coerced into installing contact tracing app_ 
Civil liberty campaigners are concerned that the public could be “coerced” into sharing data about their movements through a new coronavirus contact tracing app being developed by the government. 
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, says the app, which will be available within weeks, is “crucial for holding down the rate and the level of transmission” of Covid-19.  
But the campaign group Liberty is worried that signing up to the phone app could become a compulsory condition for returning to work and being allowed out of lockdown when conditions are eased.  
Such a condition would amount to coercion, Liberty claims. The warning came as the academic developing the app admitted that 60% of population would need to sign up to the app to make it effective.  
Clare Collier, advocacy director at Liberty, said: “By presenting surveillance tools as a solution to lockdown, the government is drawing on the willingness we have all shown to make sacrifices in the face of this crisis while refusing to show it is taking seriously the enormous risks presented by invasive technology. 
She added: “Contact-tracing technology may require us to sacrifice deeply sensitive personal information and there can be no question of state bodies or private companies sharing our personal data other than what is absolutely necessary. It is vital no-one is coerced into having the app installed, and using it as a condition for returning to work or everyday life will inevitably lead to discrimination. 
“The opportunities presented by technology should be fully investigated, but seeking quick solutions in surveillance tools that rely on our personal data creates serious long-term threats to our rights and ways of life. The government needs to focus on providing a public health response that ensures we come through this crisis with our rights intact.” 
Prof Christophe Fraser of the University of Oxford, who is leading a team developing the app, said that it would a require a very high take-up to be effective.  
“For this intervention alone to stop a resurgence of the epidemic, about 60% of the population would have to use the app,” he told the BBC.  
He added: “The app is going to be one of the building blocks of how to get out of the epidemic. For every one to two users who download the app, and who adhere to the instructions, you will prevent one infection.” 
He explained if you become infected the app will send warning messages to anyone you have who has come within Bluetooth range of your phone. He said: “You’ll either get a message which says you’ve been in contact with a suspect case of Covid-19. Or you may later get a message and you’ve been a contact of a confirmed case. At that point, we would recommend quarantine of 14 days after the contact has taken place.” 
He added: “When you install the app, this is an opt in system so it will work in the background. Your phone builds up a memory of the sort of anonymous IDs of the other phones you come into contact with. It needs to be a contact long enough that there’s a risk of transmission.” 
Asked about privacy concerns he said: “The NHS records patient data already and we trust the  NHS  to look after private data. This is being developed with a minimal amount of data – enough to make it work. It’s a public health intervention with data collected within a health system.”

Testing kits for key workers booked up within hours for third day running 
For the third day running since becoming available online, coronavirus home testing kits for key workers have been booked up within hours. 
More than 10 million key workers and their households are now eligible for Covid-19 tests as officials race to hit their 100,000-a-day testing target by next Thursday. 
By 10am home testing kits for England were listed as “unavailable” on the government’s website - two hours after booking slots reopened. But it is still possible to book tests at drive-through centres in England and Scotland.

UK universities are incapable of shifting their degrees online by the new academic year in response to the coronavirus pandemic, leading online education experts have warned. 
Simon Nelson, the chief executive of  FutureLearn , the Open University’s profit-making online learning platform, said there was insufficient time for UK universities to redesign and deliver undergraduate degrees online by September. 
His comments came as the former vice-chancellor of Edinburgh University, Sir Prof Tim O’Shea, warned that the UK higher education sector would need to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to provide just a handful of online courses next year, with most universities unprepared to deliver this. 
Nelson advised most universities to focus on creating a few key modules by September and build up from there, rather than rushing to launch whole degrees at once. He added: 
Everyone is building the train tracks as the train is running. We mustn’t attempt to boil the ocean by trying to migrate whole degrees online in a matter of months. 
Neil Mosley, digital learning designer at Cardiff University, warned that very few universities already run undergraduate courses online because they are so complex, with students able to choose from many different modules. He added: 
Even the most prepared universities will be offering some form of online undergraduate experience for the very first time. Not only that, they’ll be offering it to students who are likely to see this as second best and who haven’t previously been considered as having a strong appetite for online learning. 
When you combine all this with the lack of time, experience and support needed to create high-quality online learning, then you can see the scale of the challenge facing universities to offer high-quality online courses by September.

Stress from coping with Covid-19 pandemic could lead to a generation of “burnt-out” nurses who will leave the profession when the crisis is over, according to healthcare experts, PA Media reports. 
Researchers from the universities of Southampton and Surrey have developed guidance to help support the psychological and mental health needs of nursing staff in a bid to help them deal with the emotional and physical intensity of their work. 
Jill Maben, professor of health services research and nursing at the University of Surrey, said: 
Nurses are on the frontline of care delivery, experiencing intense emotional, social and ethical difficulties as they rise to the challenge of caring for patients in such unprecedented times. 
If we are to avoid a generation of burnt-out nurses, their physiological, psychological and safety needs must be prioritised. 
Nurses injured by stress may be the last to recognise it; they are ‘wired’ to look after others and not self and they therefore need colleagues, friends and managers to remind them to think of themselves. 
If nursing staff are not supported during this time, there is the danger that once this is all over they will leave the profession, which will put enormous strain on an already overstretched health service. 
The research, published in the Journal of Clinical Nursing, highlights that prior to the Covid-19 outbreak, nurses were already under “considerable stress” because of understaffing, with 44,000 registered nurse vacancies in the UK. 
The guidance identifies physiological and safety needs for nurses from the importance of ensuring they have enough food, drink, rest and recovery as well as protection from infection through to managers ensuring they are “highly visible and approachable”. 
Jackie Bridges, professor of older people’s care at the University of Southampton, said: 
When we’re caught up in trying to manage a crisis like Covid-19, it can be easy to be distracted from the price that is paid by nurses providing patient care. 
By making sure staff wellbeing is a priority and putting active measures in place to support nursing staff, employers in all relevant health and social care settings can reduce staff stress and distress and help ward off the development of longer-term mental health problems.

On the lockdown, Raab warned that it would not be a binary choice about lifting the restrictions. He said the public will have to adjust to a “new normal”, and that social distancing measures “are going to be with us for some time” to prevent a second spike in infections.  
Raab added: “We do need to make sure that the are next step is a sure-footed one.”  
Raab would not be drawn on when schools could open again. But he said it would be “inconceivable” that schools will go back without some form of social distancing.  
Asked if sporting activity would resume this summer, Raab warned it would be “very difficult”. But he said professional sport “may be different” amid reports that the government has been in discussion with the Premier League about playing football matches behind closed doors.

A coroner has called for further investigation into whether ingesting a toilet freshener led to the death of a two-year-old girl.  Arietta-Grace Barnett was taken to hospital after possibly ingesting the Toilet Duck capsule and vomiting a “bright pink” liquid.    She was initially judged well enough to leave hospital but was rushed back to Southampton general hospital when she began vomiting blood and died in July last year.  After a two-day inquest in Winchester, Hampshire, the coroner Rosamund Rhodes-Kemp said Arietta-Grace was believed to have swallowed a Toilet Duck gel capsule designed to stick to the toilet bowl and slowly release its chemicals.  But Rhodes-Kemp said it had not been proven that the corrosion of the girl’s oesophagus was caused by the product.  Recording a verdict of accidental death, she said further investigation was needed.  “The difficulty we have here is a connection between that product and what happened, and it seems to me that needs further investigation,” she said.  “It is designed to stick to a wet surface and not to be flushed through by water. If it does contain agents that can cause this sort of corrosion and this sort of death in a child then it’s very important the manufacturer is aware of that, can investigate themselves, and steps can be taken to prevent this tragedy occurring again.”  She added: “Toilet bowls are readily accessible to small children and these products are designed to be bright, pretty colours and attractive in smell, particularly to children.”  A paediatric surgeon, Simon Keys, told the hearing it was not certain that a chemical from the product had caused the injury and added: “If this is the explanation for the injury, it’s the first time it’s been described.  “It’s a tragedy clearly, it has wide implications for everybody in the medical community treating people with this type of injury and for the people making these products.”  Arietta-Grace’s mother, Lucy Cook, from Sarisbury Green, Hampshire, described her daughter’s last moments. She said a doctor told her they had done all they could. “I saw Arietta and there was more blood coming out, I was told it was her last breath,” she said.  “Someone gave me Arietta wrapped up in blankets. I noticed Arietta had her brown bow in her hair and she must have put this in herself.”  Earlier, Dr Nicola Trevelyan, a consultant paediatrician at Southampton general hospital, said it was not known why the girl’s vomit was pink; the capsule was blue-green.  She said no one had seen Arietta-Grace swallow the capsule, but added: “That seemed to be the most logical thing she might have taken. My experience as a paediatrician is that products that look like sweets will attract children to play with them.”   

The rapper Ceon Broughton has had his conviction for the manslaughter of his girlfriend overturned by the court of appeal.  Louella Fletcher-Michie, 24, died after taking the drug 2C-P at the  Bestival  music festival in September 2017.    Broughton, 31, who raps under the stage name CEONRPG, was  convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence  after a trial at Winchester crown court in February last year. But the conviction and his seven-year sentence were quashed on Tuesday on grounds of insufficient evidence to meet a criminal standard of proof.  Explaining the decision of the three judges, Lord Burnett said the expert evidence on the likelihood of Fletcher-Michie’s chances of survival had she received treatment sooner was “not capable of establishing causation to the criminal standard”.  “Taken at its highest, the evidence adduced by the prosecution was incapable of proving causation to the criminal standard of proof.”  In the ruling, Burnett set out how Broughton made attempts to get help as he realised Fletcher-Michie was unwell, telling a friend to “get the medics” and sending a pin of his location in the wooded area using Google Maps.  The judge said the only expert jurors had to rely on as to whether Broughton’s actions contributed “significantly” to Fletcher-Michie’s death had suggested she would have had a 90% chance of survival had she been provided with medical treatment at 9.10pm, nearly five hours after she took the drug.  Given that the criminal standard of proof requires jurors to be sure “beyond reasonable doubt”, Burnett said the expert’s evidence was “not enough”, so the issue of whether Broughton caused his girlfriend’s death by gross negligence should not have been left to the jury to decide.  It is expected Broughton will be released, as he has served his remaining sentence.  Seven years of the sentence was for the manslaughter conviction, and the court of appeal has not ordered a retrial. Broughton’s conviction for supplying Fletcher-Michie with the hallucinogenic intoxicant 2-CP at the festival stands.  He previously admitted supplying her with drugs at the Glastonbury festival, in June 2017, and was in breach of a suspended prison sentence imposed for possessing a lock knife and a Stanley knife blade.      The original trial heard that Broughton supplied Fletcher-Michie, daughter of the Holby City actor John Michie, with 2-CP at the festival before she died.  Stephen Kamlish QC, for Broughton, told the court of appeal: “The crown cannot prove, now or at trial, that she would have lived had she been treated.  “What the crown are arguing now is that by depriving the deceased of the chance of surviving via medical treatment she would have lived but that also means she might or might not have lived.”  He said Broughton had felt unable to leave Fletcher-Michie alone, in woods, while she was suffering a “bad trip”, and he had not realised she was at risk of death.  Kamlish added: “So in our submission, when one looks at the learned judge’s direction as to the ease or difficulty of obtaining help, if Louella could walk by herself it was difficult.” He said Deakin addressed whether medical intervention could have helped at trial while other experts focused on the cause of death.  Kamlish said the prosecution evidence did not prove causation against the defendant.  Broughton’s lawyers said he remained “devastated” by Fletcher-Michie’s death.  A statement issued by Birnberg Peirce solicitors said: “The court of appeal has today found that Louella’s death occurred not as a result of criminal negligence but was instead a tragic accident.  “Ceon remains devastated by her death. He has always wished that he could have done more to save her. He loved Louella and she him, but he knows that no words will ever be sufficient to convey his sense of responsibility for what happened or to begin to remove the pain that others have been caused.”  A representative for Fletcher-Michie’s family declined to comment.   

“D   ido seems to be failing upwards, given that Test and Trace has been a disaster.” That was the verdict of one NHS official on the impending appointment of Lady Harding, a Conservative peer, as the chair of the government’s new National Institute for  Health  Protection.   It will combine the roles of  NHS  Test and Trace, which she has run since its inception in May, and Public Health England, which Boris Johnson has decided to scrap – to heavy criticism from health experts and  NHS  bosses – because ministers blame it for errors which many believe are more rightly their own, especially those over testing and tracing potential carriers of the coronavirus.    Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at Southampton University, is equally unimpressed. Her new role “makes about as much sense as Chris Whitty being appointed the Vodafone head of branding and corporate image”, he said. That was a reference to Harding’s lack of experience of public health and her former role as boss of mobile phone giant TalkTalk. The British Medical Association has cautioned ministers that the new body must be “completely independent of political influence”.  However, allies point to her experience in business – she has also worked for McKinsey, Sainsbury’s and Tesco, and is a non-executive director on the Court of the Bank of England – as proof that she knows how to get things done. And although she knew little about health policy beforehand, health leaders have been impressed with how quickly she learned after being appointed chair of the regulator NHS Improvement in 2017.  She appeared polished, confident and on top of her brief when appearing at the now defunct daily Downing Street pandemic media briefing after she became the head of NHS Test and Trace. However, her concern that some of her “brilliant contact tracers are not going to be very busy” until enough people had been persuaded to get tested for coronavirus now looks questionable, given that the £10bn body has so far only tracked down 78% of everyone who has tested positive and just 72% of their close contacts.  Her dedication to the Tory cause is not in doubt.  She declined a suggestion in 2017  by the then House of Commons health select committee to sit as a crossbench peer, given her role at NHS Improvement, to make it easier for her to engage with ministers. “I have no hesitation in challenging government of whatever party,” she explained.  Her husband is John Penrose, the Tory MP for Weston-super-Mare.  He is an adviser  to  the free market  thinktank 1828, as is cabinet minister Liz Truss. It has published  articles  calling for the NHS to be replaced by universal social insurance. And also – in April, as the pandemic unfolded – for  PHE to be abolished and the private sector  to be handed a key role in testing. Both have now come to pass. His wife is now benefiting from the first and, given that private firms Serco and Sitel are doing much of Test and Trace’s work, overseeing the unfolding of the second.   

Monday   I’d never heard of  Murillo’s Immaculate Conception  before I saw the  photos of its restoration  that made the painting look like some piece of tat you used to be able to buy in Woolworth’s for less than £5. Much like I’d never come across the Ecce Homo church mural in Spain before an elderly parishioner generously  transformed it  into something that more closely resembled a chimp.    Now, if I happened to be the owner of the Murillo, I’d probably have asked to see some examples of the restorer’s work before handing over my picture to a prize bodger, but you can’t deny that the painting has now reached a global audience it had hitherto been denied.  So rather than try and get a properly trained restorer to have a third go at recreating the original, maybe it would be better to just think of it as a completely new painting. A sort of post-modernist take on an old master. The Immaculate Misconception. Given its notoriety, it might even be worth more than the original. And at least Murillo wasn’t around to see his work misunderstood or ridiculed.  When I was eight, I was astonished to find that a painting of mine had been stuck on the wall in the Highly Commended category of the school art competition. It had been given the title Two Ferrets Boxing. Which came as news to me, as I was under the impression I had spent several hours painting a couple of bears. Needless to say, I didn’t make a fuss.   Tuesday   Shortly after making a statement on the easing of lockdown guidelines in the Commons, Boris Johnson announced the end of the  daily Downing Street coronavirus press conference . The fun times were back and, with the pubs and bars reopening, he wanted to make sure everyone had as much time as possible to get pissed without any distractions.  I will miss them, though. Not just because I’ve had to watch almost all of then and I think it’s a shutting down of proper scrutiny at a time when the virus is likely to be around for at least another year, but because it was fascinating to watch ministers trying to dodge questions to which they had no answer.  The prime culprit was Boris himself, who literally  tried to silence Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance  from offering their thoughts on  Dominic Cummings’s Durham safari , but other ministers had more than their fair share of comedic moments.  There was Priti Patel declaring the government had carried out  300,034 974,000 tests , which worked out at 4616 tests for every person in the country. There was the more niche Alok Sharma, who never even pretended to give proper answers. There was  Dominic Raab insisting Boris was running the country , just hours before the prime minister was admitted to intensive care. There was anything involving the ever more petulant Matt Hancock. But my absolute favourite has to be the look of horror on the anodyne Oliver Dowden’s face when the deputy chief medical officer,  Jonathan Van-Tam, started laying into Classic Dom . For just that moment it felt like the coronavirus hadn’t turned us into a banana republic after all.  
‘You said we were going for a run in the park.’ Dilyn the dog takes Boris Johnson jogging.  Photograph: Jeremy Selwyn/Evening Standard/eyevine    Wednesday   At first glance, the  new lockdown guidelines  coming in to effect on 4 July could have been written with people as anti-social as me in mind. I’ve always found loud music in pubs and bars a complete nightmare – not least because I am going a bit deaf and can only pick up about one word in four of any conversation in a crowded space at the best of times – and an enforced seating gap at cinemas is also extremely welcome.  Mostly because it will give me more room to spread out and snooze. There’s something about the darkness and enforced disconnection from the rest of my life in a cinema auditorium – curiously, it seldom happens at the opera or the theatre – that invariably sends me off to sleep for half an hour within 10 minutes of any film starting. It drives my family mad. 
Digested week: football_s back, as its stars put the government to shame | John Crace  
Read more        But the reality is that the changes to lockdown will probably make little difference to me. Not only because I don’t want to be hanging around in pub car parks and pavements knocking back a Diet Coke, but because I have little faith in the government’s ability to make sound public health judgments.  Right now, it feels as if Boris is as keen to open up the economy as he is to save lives, so I’m going to pretty much stick with the arrangements as they are. If there hasn’t been a second spike in infections after a month, maybe I will feel safe to come out. But I’m not holding my breath. Or rather, I am.   Thursday   The curious decision to refuse to allow  cricket to restart  on the grounds that the ball is a “disease vector”, while giving professional football the go-ahead, shows a startling lack of insight into how both games are mostly played. Football is a contact sport where the ball is regularly headed and handled at throw-ins and free-kicks – not to mention the shirt-pulling and wrestling matches at set pieces – while cricket is a far gentler affair.  Especially when played by the Hemingford Hermits, possibly one of the worst cricket teams in the country. For the Hermits, a 2-metre distance between fielders was considered a bare minimum, as the field was invariably spread from the first over and the ball was seldom taken cleanly when it did come in anyone’s direction. Which would leave the bowler as the only possible source of infection: far less of a risk than a football match, I would have thought.  It was my pleasure to have played for the Hermits for more than 20 years before injury forced my retirement. A first for the team, as up till then only sudden death had led to someone being dropped. Throughout my entire career I don’t think I ever averaged more than seven – for some reason I was always considered a steady number nine batsman – and was lucky to be brought on as a third-change bowler.  Remarkably, given all this, Terry, the captain, who mysteriously always opened the batting and gave himself more overs than his talent allowed, and I, have remained the best of friends. And at the very least I can say I had a consistent career with no significant decline towards the end. My finest hour for the Hermits came after I had officially retired. They were playing with 10 men, were losing the match comprehensively and lost their ninth wicket with one ball to go. So I volunteered to go in, bunted a gentle full toss to long on and walked through for a single. A strike rate of 100 and an average of infinity.   Friday   While thousands of people used their “good old British common sense” to  flock to the beach  at the first sign of a heatwave – who could have predicted they would interpret Boris’s upbeat “Show some guts ending of hibernation” address this way? – my friend Kevin has finally had a reply from the patient experience officer of the Department for Health and Social Care’s coronavirus testing centre to his complaint about their abject failure to keep track of his results.  The letter is a collector’s item and includes lines such as ‘“we believe you should have had your results by now, but if you haven’t do get in contact with us again”. Kevin sums up the entire letter brilliantly as “Dear Kevin from Cambridge, In case you have died in the eight weeks since your first test took place, we would like to apologise to your family for both the delay in processing his test and for the delay in responding to his complaint. This last delay was caused by unprecedented numbers of complaints about delays in our system”.  To end on a more positive note, I’d like to add my congratulations to Liverpool for  winning the Premier League . The team has been a class apart from every other side both on and off the pitch all season and it would have been too cruel to have missed out on the title owing to lockdown.  The ending of every season always comes with its own personal note of sadness as I wonder if I will ever experience the joy of  Spurs  winning a league title, though. A couple of years ago it felt a genuine possibility as we had a great team and a class manager. As many have said: “It’s always the hope that kills you.”  While Liverpool stepped up a gear, Spurs let things slide and we now have a manager who doesn’t have the support of the fans or players and a team that doesn’t even love itself. All I am hoping for from the rest of the season is that we don’t manage to qualify for the  Europa League . I also can’t help feeling I should have been paying more attention when I was four and Spurs last won the league … in 1961.   Digested week digested:  Dirty Des and Honest Bob Jenrick   

The former head of a charity has been jailed for five years after he admitted defrauding a pension scheme for workers with disabilities and using the money to buy houses in England and France.  Patrick McLarry took more than £250,000 from the pension scheme of Yateley Industries for the Disabled and used it to buy homes for himself and his wife and pay off a debt for a pub lease.    The charity was so badly affected by the sophisticated fraud that it came within days of closing and service users and staff have been left traumatised.  Sentencing him at Winchester crown court, the judge, Andrew Barnett, described the fraud as “an appalling dishonesty and breach of trust”.  He said: “You quite deliberately and in a very calculating way milked the fund of a considerable amount of money which was spent for your own needs and your wife’s.”  Linda Matthews, the chief executive of the charity, said in a statement read to court that the pension scheme faced “significant difficulties” because of the stolen funds and had led to “immense stress and anxiety” for staff and users.  Alex Stein, prosecuting, said McLarry carried out the fraud by setting up a new company to manage the pension fund, of which he was one of only two directors and in the habit of authorising decisions.  He also set up a third company, which used the cover of trading in antiques to transfer the stolen money to France in order to buy two properties abroad before creating a fictional loss to explain the missing funds.  Stein said outside court: “This was a complex, sophisticated fraud undertaken over a number of years against vulnerable victims. Mr McLarry held himself out as a pillar of the community, a legitimate businessman and a man with an MBE.  “It took a persistent and tenacious investigation to uncover one of the most substantial pension frauds prosecuted to date.”  Nicola Parish, the executive director of The  Pensions  Regulator, which brought the prosecution, said: “McLarry tried every trick in the book to hide his actions and squander the pension pots of those he was responsible for but we were able to uncover the truth and bring him to justice.  “We will now work to seize assets from McLarry so that as much of the money as possible is returned to its rightful owners, who will rightly rely on it to deliver their pensions in retirement.”  McLarry, from Bere Alston village near Plymouth in Devon, was also previously convicted of failing to disclose his bank statements to the regulator’s investigators.  McLarry’s wife, Sandra, 59, was initially charged with four counts of money laundering but at an earlier hearing the prosecution said it would not proceed with the charges and offered no evidence. She was found not guilty.  Hampshire-based Yateley Industries has a onsite factory that trains and employs about 60 people with disabilities. It focuses on specialised packing, including machine shrink-wrapping and boxing.  The work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, said: “Defrauding disabled people of their hard-earned pension savings is a despicable crime. I welcome today’s sentence.  “This government will ensure that individuals who pocket people’s retirement funds feel the full force of the law. To protect savers further we are introducing new laws, with a maximum jail term of seven years, for those who wilfully or recklessly endanger pensions.”   

Staff abiding by physical distancing rules failed to notice that a passenger had lain dead on a train for five hours after a heart attack, a rail company has said. 
CrossCountry ticket inspectors on the Manchester to Bournemouth train thought the man was sleeping, the company said. Inspectors are currently advised to keep their distance from passengers because of anti-coronavirus measures. 
They only realised he had died when he remained seated after everyone else had got off at the end of the five-hour journey to Bournemouth. 
The 61-year-old man had a heart attack shortly after boarding the service from Manchester Piccadilly,  the Sun reported . He was due to get off at Stockport, eight minutes into the journey, but his body was not found until the final stop 250 miles away. 
CrossCountry said: “On Saturday 30 May we were alerted that an unresponsive customer had been discovered on our 09:27 train from Manchester on arrival at Bournemouth. The gentleman had been seen by the train crew during the journey and thought to be sleeping, but when they did not depart when the journey ended the emergency services were called, who confirmed the customer had sadly passed away. 
“Our onboard teams continue to walk through trains as part of their duties, helping customers on their journeys where they can. However, their interaction with our customers is currently reduced to maintain the recommended distance from others we are all asked to observe.” 
British Transport Police said: “We were called at 2.41pm to Bournemouth station on 30 May following reports of a sudden death onboard a train. The death was determined to be a medical matter, and the person’s family have been informed.”  

A police officer murdered his lover by strangling her in a pub car park moments after she revealed their 10-year affair by sending a text saying “I’m cheating on you” from his phone to his wife, a jury has been told.  PC Timothy Brehmer, 41, is accused of “angrily and deliberately” throttling Claire Parry, also 41, with such force that he broke a bone in her neck.    Brehmer, a constable with Dorset police, admits that he caused Parry’s death but denies murder, claiming he was “robustly” trying to get her out of his car.  Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told Salisbury crown court that in the days before her death in May, Parry came to believe that both her own marriage to another police officer and her relationship with Brehmer were coming to an end.  The barrister said Parry had carried out research into Brehmer using a fake profile on Facebook and become convinced he had had at least two other affairs.  Smith said: “Claire Parry had recently been led to believe the defendant had indulged in other affairs with other women and he was something of a womaniser. Claire Parry was facing what she might have thought was the impending end of her marriage, and the realisation that the man she had been having an affair with for years was perhaps not the man she thought he was at all, and not a man who was likely to set up with her.”  Smith said an unsent note written two days before her death was found on Parry’s phone, addressed to Brehmer’s wife, Martha, a police detective. It said: “Dear Martha, what I am going to say is likely to come as no surprise to you. I am figuring you have always suspected but tried to ignore, there is no easy way to say it but, put simply, your husband is a man whore.  “Myself and others have fallen victim to his words and charms, his promises of being in a loveless marriage to only staying for the sake of your children. He sucked me in years ago and made me believe he and I had a future until he realised you were pregnant.  “He didn’t tell me about you at first, that he was married, and when I found out he told me he was going to leave. I have since realised I was not the only one he has weaved this story to, there are at least two more. He tells us that we are special, that he has fallen in love with us.”  Smith told the court that on 9 May this year Brehmer met Parry in a car outside the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, where, after an argument, he strangled her with such force that he broke a bone in her neck.  Minutes before the incident Parry managed to send a text saying “I’m cheating on you” from Brehmer’s phone to his wife, the court heard.  Smith said Brehmer suffocated Parry in the crook of his forearm. Brehmer allegedly took a penknife to his arm and cut himself. The court was told that moments later he told a passerby: “I’m never going to see my son again, I’m going to prison for a very long time.”  Parry, a nurse practitioner from Bournemouth, was taken to Royal Bournemouth hospital but died the following day.  The prosecutor said the defendant admitted causing her death but claimed he had not intended to strangle her, and had been “simply robustly trying to get her out of the car”.  Smith added: “What the prosecution say is what the defendant did is to angrily and deliberately take Claire Parry around the neck, strangling her to death.”  At the time, Brehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, was seconded to the National Police Air Service based at Bournemouth airport.  The trial continues.   

An ex-police officer has been cleared of murder after strangling his long-term lover who had just revealed their affair to his wife.  Timothy Brehmer, 41, was found not guilty of murdering Claire Parry, also 41, in a pub car park on 9 May, but had previously admitted to manslaughter.    Brehmer, a former constable with Dorset police, said the mother of two accidentally suffered a fatal injury as he “robustly” tried to get her out of his car, minutes after she had sent a text message from his phone to his wife saying: “I am cheating on you.”  He told the jury during the trial at Salisbury crown court: “I absolutely did not want to kill her or cause serious bodily harm. I didn’t intend to kill her.”  Jo Martin QC, defending, said Brehmer was remorseful for his actions and told her after being acquitted of murder: “It doesn’t change anything. I am still responsible for Claire’s death.”  The pair had been having an affair for more than 10 years, with their relationship described by Brehmer as “a little bubble of niceness”.  On the run up to her death, Parry had carried out research into Brehmer using a fake profile on Facebook and become convinced he had had at least two other affairs, said Richard Smith QC, prosecuting.  Parry, a nurse, was in contact with a police officer called Kate Rhodes, who told her she had an affair with Brehmer in late 2011, and this made her see him “in a very different light”, the court heard.  In an unsent note on her phone written two days before her death, addressed to Brehmer’s wife Martha, a police detective, Parry had written: “… your husband is a man whore … Myself and others have fallen victim to his words and charms.  “I have since realised I was not the only one he has weaved this story to, there are at least two more. He tells us that we are special, that he has fallen in love with us.”  Brehmer said in evidence that he and Parry would go months without seeing each other, and just prior to Parry’s death in May they rarely met because of the Covid-19 lockdown, only communicating via mobile phone messages.  He revealed he had planned to kill himself because of the consequences to his family of their affair being revealed.  Brehmer told the court that when Parry got into his car outside the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, she was angry and asked for his phone so she could look through his social media apps. “She was so angry, I do not know if she was jealous of my ‘perfect life’, as she called it,” he said.  Brehmer, of Hordle, Hampshire, said that at one point he stabbed his arm three times with a penknife but Parry “did not care”. He said he demanded she get out of his car but she refused, so he tried to push her out and his arm “must have slipped up in all the melee”.  The court was told that moments later he told a passerby: “I’m never going to see my son again, I’m going to prison for a very long time.”  A postmortem examination concluded that Parry, from Bournemouth, had died from a brain injury caused by compression of the neck.  At the time of the incident, Brehmer was seconded to the National Police Air Service based at Bournemouth airport. He has since been sacked by Dorset police.  Brehmer will be sentenced at Salisbury crown court on Wednesday.   

The husband of a nurse killed by her policeman lover has said he is disappointed with the verdict, after the killer was sentenced to 10 and a half years in jail for manslaughter having previously been  cleared of her murder .  Timothy Brehmer, 41, killed Claire Parry, also 41, a married nurse and a mother of two, after she sent a text message from his phone to his wife saying: “I am cheating on you.”    Parry, from Bournemouth, died from a brain injury after severe neck compression during what was described in court as a “kerfuffle” in Brehmer’s car. The two had met in the car park of the Horns Inn in West Parley, Dorset, on 9 May, where she confronted him about another of his extramarital affairs, the court heard.  Brehmer, a constable with Dorset police, claimed Parry accidentally sustained the fatal injury as he tried to push her out of his Citroën so he could drive away, and his arm “must have slipped in all the melee”.  He was acquitted of murder by a jury at Salisbury crown court, but had previously admitted Parry’s manslaughter. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Jacobs said Brehmer must serve two-thirds of his prison sentence before applying for parole.  “This is a case where I should sentence you on the basis you lost your self-control following the sending of the text message to your wife where the affair was revealed, rather than on the basis that you had no intention to kill or cause really serious harm,” the judge said.  “I am sure that you did deliberately take Claire Parry by the neck, applying significant force with your forearm or the crook of your elbow for a period of time while she struggled against you thereby causing the severe neck injuries which the pathologist described.”  The trial heard the injuries would have resulted from significant force to the neck for a minimum 10 to 30 seconds and possibly longer.  As a “trained and experienced” road traffic police officer, Brehmer would have known Parry was seriously injured yet did nothing to help her, the judge said. He could not have thought, as he said in his police interview, she was “simply taking a breath”, the judge added.  “You must have known that her body had gone limp after your assault on her. Before you walked to the car park entrance you must have seen how she was hanging half out of the car.”  Brehmer, described in court as a “womaniser” and whose wife was a police officer, had been having an affair with Parry, whose husband was also a Dorset police officer, for more than 10 years, the court heard.  Parry had “fought hard” against Brehmer, “if only for a short while”. Brehmer had stabbed himself three times with a penknife. The judge said he had sought at the scene to blame Parry for stabbing him, lying to police and others at the time. “These lies were in my view particularly serious,” the judge added, given Brehmer’s job.  He said Brehmer only just met the “qualifying trigger” for a loss of control defence in that he had a “justifiable sense of being wronged” because he should have been the one to tell his wife about the affair.  He accepted Brehmer had “been a good policeman”, was remorseful and the killing was not premeditated. He also accepted jail would be “particularly difficult” as being a police officer placed him in a vulnerable position in prison.   Karen Ingala Smith, of the  sexual violence charity nia , which runs the  Counting Dead Women  project, said: “Timothy Brehmer’s time in jail will be significantly shorter than his relationship with Claire Parry. It will also be significantly shorter than the duration of the pain of those who loved her. The criminal justice system in this country is failing women.”  Shaista Aziz, from the domestic abuse charity  Solace Women’s Aid , said: “We welcome the judge making it clear that the violence inflicted on Claire Parry was deliberate. This is important – you can’t accidentally break someone’s neck. It’s important the record was set straight there.”  However, the judge’s comments that Brehmer lost self-control “is typical of the language used to justify violence against women and girls”, she said, and Brehmer’s suggestion “that it just happened” was typical of excuses made by perpetrators of abuse and violence, Aziz said.  After Brehmer’s acquittal for murder, the  Centre for Women’s Justice tweeted : “We know so many women serving life sentences for murder after lashing out in fear of their abusers, yet this man who is described as using ‘grooming’ techniques to exert coercive and controlling behaviour, escaped a murder conviction.”  In a statement after sentencing, Parry’s widower, Andrew, said he was “incredibly disappointed” at the verdict and believed Brehmer to be a “well-practised liar” whose account was “inconsistent and untruthful”.  Brehmer, who he said the trial had exposed as “consistently dishonest, deceitful and devious”, had conducted a factory reset on his mobile phone minutes after the killing, which “hindered the police investigation and leaves us with an incomplete picture of events on that day”, he said.  “What we do know is that Brehmer used such force against Claire that she suffered fractures to her neck, lost consciousness, went into cardiac arrest and eventually died.”  Brehmer failed to “render any assistance to her which could have saved her.” Instead he “chose to tell lies” by stating Parry had stabbed him. “This lie led to a delay in Claire receiving what could have been lifesaving treatment, a fact that remains incredibly distressing.”  The statement added: “Claire was a caring nurse practitioner who helped many people in a career of over 20 years. She was a loving family member and a doting mother who leaves behind two young children.  “Her energy and enthusiasm for life were infectious and our lives are poorer without her in them. This trial has been a horrendous ordeal for all of Claire’s family and friends. We ask that our privacy is respected while we try to rebuild our lives.”   

A statue of Edward Colston that was thrown into the harbour in  Bristol  by Black Lives Matter protesters has been retrieved and is being kept in a secure, undisclosed location. 
Bristol city council has said the slave trader’s statue will eventually be housed in a museum.

Early this morning we retrieved the statue of Colston from Bristol Harbour. It is being taken to a secure location before later forming part of our museums collection.  _  
June 11, 2020 
Meanwhile in  Poole , Dorset, the statue of the man who founded the Scout movement, Robert Baden-Powell, was being removed from the quayside on police advice. 
Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole council said it would keep the statue in safe storage while it decided what to do with it. Baden-Powell has been accused of racism, homophobia and support for Adolf Hitler. 
The council said:  “We acknowledge the differing views of the life activities of Baden-Powell and want to create time for all views to be aired, and to minimise the risk of any public disorder or antisocial behaviour that could arise were the statue to remain in situ.” 
The leader of the council, Vikki Slade, said: “Whilst famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powell’s life that are considered less worthy of commemoration. 
“Therefore, we are removing the statue so that we can properly involve all relevant communities and groups in discussions about its future, including whether a more educational presentation of his life in a different setting might be more appropriate.” 
The statue was installed in 2008 and faces Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, where the Scout movement began. Dorset County Scouts have been advised and support the move.

Colston’s statue was pulled off the plinth and dumped into the harbour during an anti-racism rally on Sunday. 
The city’s mayor, Marvin Rees, has said he  wanted to start a calm discussion  about what to do with the statue, the plinth where it stood and the other memorials and places in Bristol with links to slavery. 
He said: “I think we need to facilitate a citywide conversation about that. The conversation needs to be almost without emotion.” One issue around the statue is its ownership, with council lawyers still trying to work out whether it owns the statue. 
It was pulled down on Sunday amid worldwide protests triggered by  the death of George Floyd.  Floyd, a 46-year-old_black_man, died after a white police officer held him down by pressing his knee into his neck for almost nine minutes in Minneapolis on 25 May. 
The statue’s retrieval came after a senior Labour MP said its forced removal was the result of_years of frustration with the democratic process. 
Speaking on ITV’s Peston on Wednesday, the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, said people decided to take action over the memorial because they felt their voices on racial issues were not being heard. 
She said: “Why was that statue removed in the way that it was removed? Because for 20 years, protesters and campaigners had used every democratic lever at their disposal, petitions, meetings, protests, trying to get elected politicians to act, and they couldn’t reach a consensus and they couldn’t get anything done. 
“Now this is_reflective of what has happened to people of colour in this country_and across the world for a very long time. We’ve had seven reviews into racial discrimination in this country in the last three years alone, and very few of those recommendations have been acted on. 
“That is why people are so frustrated, and that’s the question we should be asking ourselves, is why is it so difficult for so many people to actually be heard and to pull the democratic levers to get the democratic change that they need?” 

Electric scooters will be allowed on public roads for the first time under a Department for  Transport  proposal which will consult on the rules required to allow the new technology to operate safely, the government has announced.  The legalisation of e-scooters is just one proposal in a wider plan to enable a “transport revolution”, which also involves projects to trial medical deliveries to the Isle of Wight using autonomous drones, and a test of self-driving cars between Bristol and Bath.    But the scooters, which are already in widespread, if unlawful, use across the UK, will initially only be allowed in four “future transport zones”: Portsmouth and Southampton; the West of England Combined Authority (WECA); Derby and Nottingham; and the West Midlands. 
Pedestrians ‘will face danger if e‑scooters get road approval’  
Read more        The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said the emerging technologies were “ripping up the rule book”.  He continued: “Our groundbreaking future of transport programme marks the biggest review of transport laws in a generation and will pave the way for exciting new transport technology to be tested, cementing the UK’s position as a world-leading innovator.  “This review will ensure we understand the potential impacts of a wide range of new transport types such as e-scooters, helping to properly inform any decisions on legalisation.”  In other countries, electronic scooters have become strongly associated with rental apps, such as Lime, Bird, and the Uber subsidiary Jump. However, the legal situation has prevented them from operating e-scooters in the UK, except for Bird, which found a loophole that allowed the company to trial a service that remained exclusively on private land in London’s Olympic Park.  Lime, which runs an electric bike rental scheme in the UK, welcomed the news. The company’s director of UK policy and government affairs, Alan Clarke, said: “We’re delighted that the government is exploring offering greener ways to travel.  “Shared electric scooters are a safe, emission-free, affordable and convenient way of getting around. They help take cars off the road, with around a quarter of e-scooter trips replacing a car journey, cutting congestion and reducing air pollution.”  The government needs to amend legislation before the pilot schemes can begin, however, meaning it will be several months until e-scooters are allowed on UK roads. Under current laws, powered transport must fall into one of three broad categories: cars and motorcycles, which require licences, MOT checks and registration; electric bikes, which are effectively treated as normal bicycles provided they are pedal-assist; and electric wheelchairs and mobility scooters, which have a special allowance to be used on pavements.  The trial will assess what new restrictions should be put in place, such as a minimum age for riders, speed limits, licensing, insurance and helmets.  Other topics include minimum design standards, whether they should be allowed in cycle lanes, and what powers local authorities should have to manage e-scooter hire firms.  The absence of legislation enabling legal use of e-scooters on public roads has not prevented them being sold in Britain, however. The YouTube star and TV presenter Emily Hartridge became the first person in the UK to be killed  while riding an e-scooter  when she was struck by a lorry in Battersea, south London, in July last year, and the Metropolitan police stopped nearly 100 riders in London in a single week last summer.   

A senior police officer has condemned deep-seated prejudice for making it acceptable to label the UK Travelling community “inherently criminal”. 
Speaking after the three killers of PC Andrew Harper were  jailed for manslaughter , Janette McCormick, deputy chief constable at the College of Policing, said attention was required to tackle the inequality and job prospects facing Travellers. 
The three men were jailed on Friday for a total of 42 years. 
“There seems to be a deep-seated and accepted prejudice that demonises people from the community. You wouldn’t call any other ethnicity inherently criminal,” said McCormick, also the  National Police Chiefs’ Council  lead for Gypsies, Roma and Travellers. 
Media reports on Saturday carried criticism of the travelling community, centred on the Four Houses Corner Travellers’ site in Burghfield Common, Berkshire, that the killers came from, and stated that Henry Long, 19, the leader of the gang, had admitted his grandfather and father were also thieves. 
However, McCormick said it was important to note that the broader link between crime and UK Traveller communities was not conclusive. “There is no evidence to suggest we have a disproportionately high crime rate around Traveller sites,” she said.

The officer added: “The reality is within the communities you have huge disadvantages such as health, literacy, job prospects. Like any community where you have significant disadvantage, that can be correlated with crime. But you shouldn’t link to ethnicity, it’s the disadvantage we need to have the conversation about.” 
Harper, 28, died as he attempted to apprehend the three teenagers who were trying to steal a quad bike. The officer became entangled in a tow rope attached to their Seat Toledo and was dragged at “breakneck” speed for more than a mile along country lanes. Long, who was driving the car towing a stolen quad bike, was jailed for 16 years, while his accomplices Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole were each given 13 years. 
The UK’s Traveller movement spoke out to strongly condemn the actions of the three killers, as well as their alleged lack of remorse and laughter during the trial. 
Pauline Anderson, chair of The Traveller Movement, said: “Those lads are out of the picture now. PC Harper’s family will never recover. Nor will their families. 
“There’s so much shock and horror that this should happen – and to someone in the line of duty. The alleged lack of remorse is unforgivable.” 
Other prominent figures in the Travelling community used even stronger language. 
Thomas McCarthy, an Irish Traveller folk singer, said: “PC Harper was somebody’s son. I don’t care what background you have, if you rob someone, kill someone, you face the consequences like anybody else. They don’t represent our community.” 
But the fact that the case has been exploited by some quarters to stir up  longstanding negative stereotypes  has worried experts. 
Colin Clark, a sociology professor at the University of the West of Scotland who has studied the UK Travelling community, said: “Some of the reporting on the case has suggested that being born a Traveller is a kind of criminal apprenticeship and that racist assumption needs to be challenged.” 
Chris Kidd, a social work student at Bournemouth University who has carried out research for his MA into prejudice against Gypsy, Roma and Traveller communities, also said that perceptions within the police and settled communities around higher crime rates were without substance. 
Kidd points to a 2016 study in one area of Romania, which demonstrated that areas with higher Roma populations had lower levels of crime. He added that stereotypes – such as the alleged theft of children by Travelling communities – were prevalent as long ago as the 19th century. 
“Anti-Roma prejudice and stereotypes seem to constitute a pan-European phenomenon,” said Kidd. 
Another  cause of disquiet  among the Travelling community is the  Channel 4 Dispatches programme  which was broadcast in April, and which looked at links between higher levels of crime and the location of some Traveller sites. The programme, about which the regulator, Ofcom, reportedly received thousands of complaints, remains available to watch, despite concerns from some police officers and academics over its accuracy. 
Other issues include the  recent consultation  on criminalising trespass, which would give the police powers to confiscate the homes of those suspected of trespassing – a proposed change which would affect many homeless community members, who pull up on roadsides and in other places on a temporary basis.

“It is a bit disappointing that the only work within government is to criminalise trespass – I can see why community members feel that things are very attritional,” said McCormick. 
Others lament some of the media coverage of the Harper trial for asserting that being born into nomadic communities equates to being born into criminality. 
Chelsea McDonagh, a young postgraduate and activist from a Traveller background, says: “The most damaging part of this is the wider discourse, by both the media and politicians, that Travellers are not adequately controlled. 
“There is absolutely no justification for what those three individuals did, but for journalists to say that our culture is the problem, that’s really grossly offensive.” 
McDonagh was particularly affronted by calls for the wider community to be punished for the actions of Harper’s killers. 
“Some voices are saying their families should be evicted. Why should they be punished for actions that are not their own? If you do bad, you are always a Traveller. But my ethnicity is not relevant when I’ve done something good.” 
Two of Harper’s killers reportedly came from English Romani backgrounds, with the background of the third unknown. At the Berkshire site where Long was arrested, English Romanies and Irish Travellers live alongside each other. 
There are a number of nomadic communities living in the UK – the three most populous being English Gypsies, Irish (and Scots and Welsh) Travellers, and more recently arrived Roma – making up the umbrella group often referred to as the GRT communities. 
We are asking for an understanding that we condemn this crime, that it was morally wrong 
Pauline Anderson, chair of the Travellers Movement 
In addition, there are smaller communities, including Showpeople, associated for centuries with travelling shows, and boat-dwellers, as well as New Travellers, many of whom took to the road during the Thatcher era. 
Clark said that, for some sections of the media, the idea that all Travellers were born criminals would continue to prevail. 
“This idea that Travellers are born criminals due to genetics and culture goes back to the Holocaust. 
“It’s depressing to read newspaper columnists who suggest ‘Traveller culture’ makes you a criminal at birth. It’s just not true.” 
But Anderson conceded that they needed to investigate the factors that drove Long, Bowers and Cole to commit the dreadful crime. 
“What were the clues in the journey that those young people made? Our community should be given the space to condemn the crime, but not to bear the responsibility for it as an ethnic group. 
“Let’s look at the complexities of the causes of crime, the causal links between poverty and crime, let’s tackle that. We are asking for an understanding that we condemn this crime, that it was morally wrong.” 
McCarthy added: “We want to fight to be part of society, but you get something like this and it pushes us back so far. ” 
McDonagh, 24, said she wondered what lay in store for her generation. 
“I have put my head above the parapet, but it takes a toll. We are working together collectively, and we are countering stereotypes, but our stories are not the ones people want to hear about.”

Tens of thousands of people descended on beaches on the south coast of England on the hottest day of the year, prompting some local authorities to plead with people to stay away so that social distancing could be maintained.  While many parts of the north of England were facing a  fresh lockdown , stretches of beaches at Bournemouth, Poole and Brighton were packed.    At Bournemouth, where a major  incident was declared last month  because the beach was so busy, the council asked people to steer clear of some areas because physical distancing was not possible.  Despite the warnings, groups of up to 50 teenagers, and men and women in their early 20s gathered. Security guards removed some men who were drinking under the pier but no attempts were made to close the beaches or to to ask people to leave.  One sun-seeker, 18-year-old Lizzie Jones from Portsmouth, who was on the beach with a dozen friends, said she felt perfectly safe and didn’t feel she was putting anyone at risk. “We’re out here in the fresh air. People are a bit close but I don’t think there’s much of a danger,” she said.  Some car parks were full, prompting scores of people to abandon their vehicles illegally.  A digital sign informed people that the beach was “too busy”. A new app produced by the local authority,  Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole council, urged people to avoid long stretches of the beaches with the message: “Avoid, safe social distancing not possible.”  Tom, who was on the beach with a group of school and college friends aged 17 and 18 who had travelled to Bournemouth on the train from Southampton, said: “It feels safe to me. I don’t know anyone who has had coronavirus. Until I do I don’t think it will feel real to me.”  Local people were wary. Rod Underhill, 65, was sunbathing outside his beach hut. He said it was clear that large groups of young people were not social distancing. But he said: “We’ve worked out our route to and from the beach to make sure we’ll avoid the worst of it. You just have to be sensible.”  Vikki Slade, the leader of BCP council, said the resorts were excited to welcome people. She said Bournemouth and  Poole  were stretched in June when up to half a million people arrived at a time when hotels, restaurants and pubs were closed.  “I was appalled at the resulting littering, illegal parking, anti-social behaviour and personal abuse that our hard-working teams had to deal with,” she said.  “As a result of our experiences we have introduced marshals at busy car park entrances, extended our security provision, enhanced our first-aid provision and put additional traffic management plans in place.”  The council and police were ready to set up road blocks and tow cars dangerously parked away.  Police officers were working for extended hours  and leave was cancelled for some.  Further east, Brighton and Hove city council expressed fears over the number of people on its beaches.  It tweeted : “We’re concerned about the number of people in the city. If you’re not already here, please don’t travel to the city today. There is limited capacity on public transport. Large numbers make it impossible to maintain physical distancing.”

In Kent, Thanet council said some of its most popular strands were full. It  tweeted : “Please avoid our most popular beaches today as it’s now extremely busy. We have 19 miles of coastline, so consider all the places you could visit or come back at a quieter time.”  The Met Office said the temperature reached 37.8C at Heathrow and 37.3C at Kew Gardens, making it the third hottest day on record in the UK.  A “yellow warning” was issued by the Met Office for thunderstorms valid from 4pm on Friday until midnight across large parts of east and south-east England. Cooler weather is expected for the weekend.

A good day’s work for England:  runs in the bank and for the two men who hadn’t passed fifty this summer - an unbroken partnership of 136. Buttler had an understandably wary start but freed the shoulders with those two sixes off Cornwall and looked increasingly confident. Pope was all ease and poise and timing. He sleeps, nine short of his century.  
Jason Holder’s decision to bowl first hasn’t paid off but they still have the morning, and they still have the new ball, and they still have the England tail. Kemar Roach was the pick of the bowlers.  
Thanks for all your emails, sorry I couldn’t use them all, time for me to make the schlep to the kitchen for a Friday night schlurp. Good night!

STUMPS England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91) 
That’s that then folks.  The hover covers float into place and England will be hoping that weather forecast bucks up. A reminder that batsmen can’t accept or decline the light any more, it’s purely the umpires’ decision.  
A hoarse sounding Ollie Pope is being interviewed.  “Jos is a nice guy to bat with, he doesn’t need me telling him how to bat. The pitch spun a little bit, still a little bit of nip in it for the bowlers, a pretty good wicket, not as much pace as we thought. The West Indies have looked after the ball well.  
“ [Getting 90] does feel like a little bit of weight off the shoulders, with the pandemic we haven’t played cricket for a while. In such an intense environment, we haven’t been able to get out and see our family, we go back into the hotel room and look out over the cricket pitch. To be honest I have found it a little bit challenging, you just end up playing dismissals over and over again. “

85.4 over: England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91)    After four dot balls, the umpires draw together like a couple of shifty looking dealers .

85th over: England 258-4 (Buttler 56, Pope 91)    Roach has Pope in a touch of trouble. Pope pushes him awkwardly just short of the cover fielder and pulls at a bouncer rather wildly, but to the final ball he storms into the 90s with an on-drive. (an irrelevant aside: I never find an on-drive as easy on the eye as an off-drive) 
Good afternoon Tanya, writes Geoff Wignall, “Too late now to advise you to plead a typo - schlepping for skelping. Jos Buttler is as fine a skelper as you’ll find, but he’ll never be anywhere near as good a keeper as Foakes which is one reason the doubters will continue to doubt. “

84th over: England 252-4 (Buttler 55, Pope 85)  Gabriel hurtles in; his first ball flies aimlessly past Buttler’s off stump. And so it continues for the rest of the over. 
Some Buttlerstatism: this is Buttler’s 17th 50 in Test cricket, only five times has he reached fifty in fewer than 80 balls. Basically, he’s more of a classical Test batsman in Tests than you think. The question is whether he  should  be forcing himself into that mode 
James Philpot is pondering the unkind Manchester weather:  “Presumably, the England dressing room is aware of the forecast for the next few days - how heavily do you think that will weigh in their minds, given the fact that England have to force a result? #Batdeep doesn’t seem to be applicable any more given the heavy bowling lineup, if England sneak up towards 300 tonight, could we see an overnight declaration? “  
I  think  they’d rather bat “big” and gamble on bowling the Windies out twice?

“I’m not really a Buttler sceptic or detractor (I tend to hope that whoever is playing does well, since that generally me as that the team does), but I think that the number that Buttler needs is three or four’”  writes Chris Howell.   “As in, three or four innings of substance in the remaining tests this summer. It’s a little unfair, in that his 35 at Southampton was overshadowed by the collapse going on around him, while the 40 last game here was overshadowed by what had gone before. It’s good to see him currently being involved in a partnership that is changing the nature of the game England’s way, as he does so often in limited overs matches.”

77th over: England 223-4 (Buttler 40, Pope 71)  Cornwall roars an appeal against Pope who looks worried enough for Holder to call for the third umpire. It hit him plump on the front leg, but the review assumes some MASSIVE turn that has the ball ripping past leg. Not out and West Indies lose a review.  
Should we be faced with an appeal by Gabriel over a decision regarding Pope, should the umpires refer the appeal to Upstairs, as unopposed to merely upstairs?  asks Andrew Tyacke.  And how will the decision be conveyed to the field umpires? Personally I favour a thunderbolt to strike the one in the wrong but maybe a short chorus from a celestial choir might be more in keeping with the tranquil nature of cricketing tradition.

“What number will satisfy Buttler sceptics?”  asks Will Wiles . It may not last but so far this is a proper Test innings from Buttler.   For me anything more than 50 and he’s done enough to quiet the detractors for the rest of the summer. He’s applying himself to the red ball and needs time and experience just like the top order.”   
Fifty would save him for the summer but not quiet the doubters. A hundred would buy him till the winter tour.

To add to the pedantry: did you mean “to the manner born”, as in Hamlet Act 1, Scene 4 (“But to my mind, though I am native here / And to the manner born...”)? Or is this a pun on Pope’s Chelsea beginnings?   
And Graeme Thorn: 
Whilst we’re talking language and pedantry, the phrase is “to the manner born”, ultimately deriving from Hamlet. “To the Manor Born” was the sitcom with the punning title referring to this phrase.

63rd over: England 173-4 (Buttler 12, Pope 51)  Pope pretties up fifty with another boundary, a powerful off drive, his sixth boundary of the innings. He really is to the manor born. 
It appears my German GCSE has let me down. I’m handing this over to you.  
First Andrew Leal : ”I hate to be pedantic, but what the heck. „Schleppen“ actually means to tow in German rather than to toe, which puts a slightly different perspective on Burns‘s shot.”  
And Timothy Reston: “ In German “schleppen” does not mean “toe” but rather “tow”. So might be used most appropriately for a pull shot.”  
Adrian Goldman with the Yiddish angle.  “I think we should also point out that the word in English, derives from Yiddish, as in the phrase “schlepping tons of extra baggage to the airport”. - dragging it along the ground.  
Which is truly an astonishing way to play a cricket shot, and implies that he actually walked alongside the ball all the way to boundary. I believe this is against the rules of cricket?

David Keech writes.  “Schleps” is derived from the German word “Scleppen”. It has a ton of different meanings in German but the official English translation is “toe”. So “Burns toes it to the boundary”???  
Would it be terribly remiss to admit I can’t actually remember the stroke in forensic detail now? But I don’t think a toeing does it justice.

Try using the phrase ‘juicy half volley’ to a non-cricket enthusiast and seeing their reaction.

Lords 1986 against India, England played Derek Pringle at 6 and John Emburey in the first innings and Paul Downton in the second at 7. Pringle scored his only Test 50. Neither he, Downton or Emburey ever managed a hundred. Either way, our current line up looks an absolute tower of strength by comparison...    
So true, though I remember with some affection Emburey sweeping in his visored helmet, presumably taught by his great mate Goochie.

He has started like a man in form - busy, purposeful and light on his feet. 
“Quite what one calls them is (as we have learned) open to question, but have England ever fielded a No6 and 7 with just two Test centuries between them in 133 innings?” challenges Gary Naylor. “Centuries shape innings and England might be hearing ‘Last Orders’ in the saloon already.

“Interesting comment from Peter Williams,” says David Murray. “But surely, no matter what the stats say, Botham was a better batsman than Imran Khan, and Khan was a better bowler.” 
They sort of overlapped, didn’t they? I’d say Beefy was the better batsman up until around 1984, though I haven’t checked the data. It’s hard to judge Beefy because his numbers towards the end were relatively diabolical, which makes it even funnier that he managed to ruin Australia armed with little more than aura, a mullet and long hops.

We all do it. But Kapil Dev resists all classifications bar one. Kapil was quite simply the most exhausted-looking cricketer in history. That’s because he  was  the most exhausted cricketer ever. To do him justice you need to be slightly disobliging about the Indian ‘pace’ attack of the era. Because he was it. For nearly a decade, he was an international strike force all on his own. His moustache didn’t droop that way because of fashion, it was the relentless gravity of uttermost (and sometimes thankless) effort. It was noble, magnificent and caused worship in all boyish hearts. To call such a man an all-rounder is near libellous. Kapil Dev looked permanently knackered because he  was  permanently knackered. He was a whole team. He gets his own genus.”

A British former paratrooper has dropped 40 metres from a helicopter into the sea in an attempt to break the world record for jumping without a parachute. 
John Bream was taken to hospital to be examined following the leap after he landed in the water awkwardly and briefly fell unconscious. 
The 34-year-old from Havant, Hampshire, was thought to have hit the water at about 80mph off Hayling Island on Monday after falling the equivalent of nine storeys.

Nicknamed “The Flying Fish”, Bream was attempting to beat the world record for jumping from an aircraft into water without a parachute to raise funds for service personnel mental health charities. 
Two safety divers and a support boat were on hand to help Bream in the water immediately after landing. 
He was seen walking and chatting with paramedics as he was checked over before being taken to hospital. 
Bream said he was attempting the feat to “raise awareness and help prevent veteran suicide” and “to prove veterans can still achieve brilliance”. 
He said the bravery required for the jump was nothing compared with the courage shown by troops on the frontline, and said he hoped the event would motivate veterans in the country. 
All the money Bream raises  will be donated to the charities All Call Signs and Support Our Paras.

Under Brexit’s  Northern Ireland  protocol, all products are normally permitted to be exported from the EU to  Northern Ireland  without checks, as NI remains in the single market for goods and continues to operate under EU custom rules.  The protocol was a resolution to the sticky Irish border question and was designed to avoid a return of checkpoints along the politically sensitive frontier and minimise potential disruption of cross-border trade.    However, amid a row over vaccine delivery shortfalls, the EU has invoked article 16 of the NI protocol which allows the EU or UK to unilaterally suspend aspects of its operations if either side considers that aspect to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.

Read more        The mechanism, which was created as a temporary measure, is only supposed to be triggered in the face of “serious” problems, but there is no definition of what “serious” entails.  If one side triggers article 16, the other side is open to take rebalancing action in response.  The move is seen as part of the EU’s  efforts to place controls on the export of Covid vaccines  amid  its escalating row with AstraZeneca  over its supply contract.  From a UK context, the NI protocol could present a back door for exporters to circumvent those controls and move vaccines into the UK unchecked, as trade from the EU into NI – as well as trade from NI to GB – is unrestricted under the protocol. Triggering article 16 in respect of the movement of the vaccines closes that back door.   

The wearing of cloth face masks by the public was becoming more about politics than science, one expert has argued, as a new study reveals potential benefits and problems of the coverings. 
At present the UK government recommends  the public wear face coverings  when in crowded places where it is not always possible to maintain social distancing – a stance also taken by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – while other countries,  including the Czech Republic , have made the wearing of masks in the community mandatory. 
Now a new study  by researchers at the University of Edinburgh has looked into the impact of different types of face mask on airflow ejected by a wearer when they breathed or coughed, including standard surgical masks, FFP2 respirators and cloth masks. 
The researchers found all face masks without a valve, including cloth masks, reduced the distance exhaled air travelled in a forward direction by more than 90%. But they added that fit was essential, pointing out that “surgical, handmade masks, and face shields, generate significant leakage jets that have the potential to disperse virus-laden fluid particles by several metres,” and that such jets tend to be directed downwards or backwards.

Dr Simon Kolstoe, senior lecturer in evidence-based healthcare and university ethics adviser at the University of Portsmouth, said when it comes to the science there “isn’t that much to argue about”. He said the new study backs previous evidence that cloth masks were not as effective as FFP1 or FFP2 masks – equivalent to N95 masks – when it comes to preventing the transmission of viruses, but can direct the breath in different ways. 
But Kolstoe said there was limited evidence about how effective cloth masks were, or whether they have a big impact. The upshot was a debate that was  more political than scientific .

“My feeling is that this is becoming more of a statement, a statement of solidarity. By going out and wearing a face mask you show that you are taking action, you show other people you are concerned about this, you are concerned about them, you are concerned about yourself. But perhaps conversely by not wearing a face mask that is also a statement as well,” said Kolstoe, pointing to a recent Politico article with the headline “ Wearing a mask is for smug liberals. Refusing to is for reckless Republicans .” 
Trish Greenhalgh, a professor of primary care health sciences at Oxford University,  who has advocated the public wear cloth face masks , cautioned that the Edinburgh research was carried out in a laboratory, meaning the implications for the real world remain unclear. However, she said the findings suggested those wearing surgical or homemade masks to protect others should ensure a close fit all around. 
Other experts pointed out that the study did not look at viral transmission and the face coverings were only tested on one person, but the findings showed that airflow was not straightforward. 

Tributes have been paid to a “kind and compassionate” 15-year-old girl who died in a speedboat accident, as police continued to  call for witnesses to the tragedy  in Southampton Water.  Emily Lewis, 15, was among 12 people taken to hospital after the rigid inflatable boat collided with a buoy off the Hampshire coast on Saturday. She was pronounced dead in hospital.    In a statement issued through the police on Monday, Emily’s family said: “Our beautiful daughter passed away on Saturday. We suffered from broken bones, but the emotional pain far outweighs the physical.  “We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us, and words just don’t seem available to express our deep sense of loss.”  The collision happened just after 10.10am on Saturday, Hampshire police said. It is understood that Emily’s father Simon, mother Nikki and 19-year-old sister Amy were also on the boat, and that both her mother and sister suffered broken arms.  Stuart Parkes, the headteacher at Brookfield school in Fareham, Hampshire, where Emily was a student, said: “Emily was a kind and compassionate young lady who cared deeply about those around her.  “Her caring showed no bounds; from volunteering to support new students through to becoming a student leader with aspirations to help shape the education of every student in our school.  “She was a creative soul who loved textiles and design and who showed great potential. She was motivated and dedicated to her studies, a positive example to all.  “Emily was a bright, conscientious student who will be sorely missed by all staff and students at Brookfield.”  Conditions in  Southampton  Water were very difficult on Saturday as strong spring tides combined with powerful winds.  Police said all the other passengers received hospital treatment – some for serious injuries. Emily’s family is being supported by specialist officers.  The Hampshire force said it was investigating the circumstances of the collision and continued to appeal for any information or footage that could help.  Detectives are keen to hear from people who were on a ferry heading to East Cowes on the Isle of Wight from Southampton at 10am or anyone else who was on the water between  Netley Abbey  and Hythe Pier at about the same time.  Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting Operation Orange, or to submit information and visually recorded evidence via its major incident public portal.     

The first charter flight in the £75m coronavirus rescue operation will leave  Algeria  on 2 April, with departures from South Africa, Nepal and India to follow.  As the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, and the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, continue negotiations to get a series of charter flights to help the most vulnerable stranded UK nationals, British embassies around the world disclosed details of operations under way. There are thought to be about 400,000 Britons stranded overseas.    The flight from Algeria will offer seats costing £186, according to the Foreign Office. Flights out of the  country were suspended on 19 March  leaving few options for British travellers or charity workers who wanted to leave.  In South Africa, the British high commissioner, Nigel Casey,  went on national TV  to say his team was working “flat out” to organise charter flights, with permission in principle to fly already granted by the country’s government.  So far 2,500 people have registered to leave but Casey said the number seeking repatriation was more likely to be between 5,000 and 7,500.  He also revealed that 179 elderly Britons on the luxury liner Queen Mary 2 were on their way back to the UK after the ship’s captain got permission to refuel in Durban.

Nicola Pollitt, the British ambassador in Nepal, confirmed there would be charter flights out of the country and that ticket prices would be capped.  She also revealed on social media that British Gurkhas had been helping to extract tourists from remote locations, including six trekkers in the Himalayan Langtang region and seven in the mountainous district of Manang.

Jan Thompson  said  there were “many thousand of British nationals” stranded and that the dates and location of flights would be announced as soon as they were confirmed.  The British ambassador in Thailand warned thousands stranded not to expect charter flights as commercial airlines were still allowed to fly. This was of no comfort to people facing multiple cancellations, exorbitant pricing and and no instant refunds.  One mother who contacted the Guardian said she was at her wits’ end over efforts to get her young son home. “We bought a ticket on Etihad Airways which was cancelled and cost £1,000. We bought another ticket for over £1,200 with Qatar Airways on Friday after getting nowhere with our MP or the Foreign Office,” she said.   Up to 10,000 British nationals stranded in New Zealand, which is just days into a four-week lockdown, have been warned by the high commissioner, Laura Clarke, that they may not be on the target list.  “It hasn’t been decided yet if the programme will include New Zealand and I don’t want to over-promise. There are Britons stuck all over the world, some of them in much more dangerous situations, in countries where the health systems aren’t functioning at all,” she said.  She confirmed that 10,000 had registered their desire to leave the country, and added: “If there are chartered flights, it won’t happen straight away and it won’t be a silver bullet.”

One elderly UK national is among four people to have died on the coronavirus-stricken cruise ship the Zaandam, where nine people have tested positive for Covid-19 and dozens are ill with flu-like symptoms.  British passengers thanked Donald Trump after he said he would intervene to prevent the Zaandam and its sister vessel, the Rotterdam , which are trying to dock in Florida, from becoming “ghost ships”.  Trump said on Tuesday he would discuss the matter with the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who previously said he would not allow the vessels of mostly “foreigners” to be dumped in his state.  The ships do not yet have final approval to dock at Fort Lauderdale but the US president said he was “going to do what is right not only for us but for humanity”.  Hundreds of passengers, including 229 British nationals, have been confined to their cabins for more than a week after several Latin American countries refused to allow the Zaandam into port or evacuate critically ill passengers, leaving the cruise liner stranded at sea.  The Rotterdam was then sent on a rescue operation to meet its sister ship off the coast of Panama, where symptomless passengers were transferred on to it.  “Thanks to President Trump for overturning the Florida governor’s decision and allowing us to dock and make arrangements to get back to the UK,” Raksha, a British passenger on the Rotterdam, told the Guardian.

Terms and conditions          Guy Jones, whose parents, Nick and Celia, are also on the Rotterdam, said: “I am encouraged by President Trump’s comments during his press briefing last night about assisting the Zaandam and the Rotterdam.  “There are people onboard both ships that need medical care and on the Zaandam in particular. This needs to happen as soon as humanly possible.”  On Wednesday both ships briefly stopped off the coast of Cuba to transfer a nurse and oxygen from the Rotterdam to the Zaandam. Representatives have previously warned that two critical patients on the Zaandam might die before they reach Florida.   

T   he first arrests took place on the harbour at Yarmouth, the cobbled, picture-book port that lies on the Isle of Wight’s quieter western side. It was a Sunday evening, 30 May 2010, almost a decade ago, but Nicky Green still sees it in Technicolor. She was working in Salty’s, the family’s restaurant just yards from the marina. “It was the bank holiday weekend and we were absolutely stacked,” she says. Her parents were serving behind the bar, her daughter was waiting tables and her younger brother, Jamie, a 42-year-old fisherman, was out on the quay, just back from sea. “I’d called and asked him to bring in some lobsters,” Nicky recalls. “I was expecting him to walk through the door when someone told me he’d been arrested.”   In the moment, she was too busy to follow it up. “I was juggling the food, the crowds, the tables, and I knew Jamie was having an issue with some other fishermen – they were accusing each other of pinching lobster pots, and he was dodging the CID guy trying to deal with it. I thought this was fishermen bickering. I never on this Earth thought it was serious. How would I have ever imagined the gravity?”    But Jamie Green never came back. A year later, on 2 June 2011, Green, his crew of three – Scott Birtwistle, Daniel Payne and Zoran Dresic, as well as Jonathan Beere, a local scaffolder – were found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs. Their sentences, a combined total of 104 years, reflected the scale of the haul: a fisherman had found 250kg of cocaine worth an estimated £53m roped together in holdalls and floating in the island’s Freshwater Bay.  
Nicky Green, whose brother Jamie was one of the five men found guilty of conspiracy to import class A drugs.  Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian   The men, now known as the Freshwater Five, were not typical multimillion-pound drug smugglers. They had no previous convictions relating to drugs or dishonesty, no forensic evidence linked them to the cocaine, and a Proceeds of  Crime  Act inquiry assessed their gains from criminality at zero. They did not lead lavish lifestyles, and how they planned to distribute such a quantity of drugs was not made clear. The case has rocked the island, dividing friends, family and fishermen. While Birtwistle and Payne are out on licence, the remaining three men are nine years into 24-year sentences. Now new evidence means their case is coming back to the appeal court, a chance for all five to clear their names.  ***         As a kid, Jamie was fishing mad – that’s all
he’s done. He was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn’t suffer fools gladly’       A couple of miles across the Solent from the UK mainland, the Isle of Wight’s private beaches, secluded inlets and narrow valleys have made it a smuggling base for centuries. It remains strangely isolated, a place where many juggle two or three jobs, since wages, employment and opportunities are all markedly lower than in the rest of the south-east. But for most, smuggling has been relegated to movies and history books. Today, the movement of drugs, firearms and people belongs to organised crime – which is partly why the Freshwater Five case stands out.  Jamie Green, the central figure linking the men, was born and raised on the island; at trial, the prosecution accepted that he was “a legitimate lobster fisherman”. His parents founded Salty’s more than 25 years ago, converting a garage first into a fish shop, then a bar and restaurant, which are now under new ownership. “As a kid, Jamie was fishing mad – that’s all he has ever done,” Nicky says. Green left school at 16, got his first boat at 17, and by 2010 owned the 39ft Galwad-y-Mor, supplying London restaurants and fishmongers, and exporting to mainland Europe.  The family were well known in Yarmouth. Green had convictions for public order offences and drunkenness – and always pleaded guilty. “He was a rufty-tufty fisherman who didn’t suffer fools gladly, and there are a lot of fools round Yarmouth,” Nicky says. At the time of his arrest, Nikki, his wife of 21 years and the mother of their three children, was being treated for breast cancer.  Birtwistle, the Galwad’s only permanent crew member, saw Green as a mentor. Now 29, he has moved back home with his mother on the mainland in Selsey, a seaside town in Sussex. Calm and measured, he’s balancing his wish to speak out with a wariness of not being believed.         The police had intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship to be picked up by a smaller boat       Like Green, Birtwistle had always loved fishing. “I loved the freedom. It didn’t even feel like a job,” he says. On leaving school, he placed an ad on findafishingboat.com. Green contacted him in December 2009, and within weeks Birtwistle had moved to the island to live in a caravan on Green’s land and crew the Galwad. “Jamie knew his stuff and taught me so much,” he says. “In Selsey, skippers take control and don’t teach you anything in case you get your own boat and take their business. Jamie was different.”  Danny Payne, now 45, had known Green since his teens. Now back on the Isle of Wight, he’s working on building sites, still adjusting to “life outside”. Payne had been a more reluctant crew member on that bank holiday trip. “Do you know Quint, the shark hunter from Jaws?” Payne asks. “Well, that was Jamie. I used to call him Quint. He’d bark and shout if you were doing it wrong, but he sure knows his way around a boat.  “I’d worked for Jamie a lot over the years and used to enjoy it,” he continues. “My dad was a submariner, and I’ve always been around the sea. But by then, I was living with my girlfriend, we had a rescue dog and I didn’t want to go out on the boat for days on end. I was doing more building work for nearly as much money, but I knew Nikki was ill and Jamie was having problems finding crew. It’s ridiculously hard and always dangerous – even in the calmest weather, there’s rope flying, the stink of rotting crab and fish and diesel. Most people only came once.”  
Freshwater Bay, Isle Of Wight, where 11 holdalls filled with cocaine worth £53m were found floating in 2010.  Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian   Zoran Dresic, 36 and from Montenegro, was the third crew member. Married with three children, he’d worked in Austria and Italy before coming to the UK on a false passport just two days before. According to Dresic, he’d been promised work by a friend of a friend. This was not unusual – the whole fishing industry uses foreign crew and the Yarmouth harbourmaster confirmed the Galwad’s high turnover. However, the prosecution’s case was that Dresic, who spoke no English and had little if any fishing experience, had come with the express purpose of overseeing a drug drop, and that the “friends of friends” – two men who’d delivered Dresic to the island before returning to the mainland and disappearing – were coconspirators.  Green set sail with his crew on the afternoon of Saturday 29 May, heading to the shipping lanes where cargo ships head east to Europe or west to the United States. According to Green, the forecast was bad but expected to break around midnight, by which time they’d have reached the five-mile central reservation between the lanes, less heavily fished and rich with spring tides. What he couldn’t have known was that it was also the centre of a massive police operation that weekend, run by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) and Middle Market  Drugs  Partnership (both of which have since been disbanded).         The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Every inch of the boat was scanned, but no molecule of cocaine was found       Operation Disorient had received intelligence that a drug delivery was arriving on a container ship, to be picked up by a smaller boat and taken ashore. Patrol ships and surveillance planes were looking out, and at some point the Galwad crossed their radar. Mid-channel, where the suspected transfer took place, in the dead of night in a force eight gale, there was nothing much to see. The Galwad’s instruments show that the boat never stopped moving, though at 12.40am, for three and a half minutes, it reduced its speed from 5 knots to .57 of a knot. The prosecution claimed this was sufficient for Green and his crew to recover 11 holdalls of cocaine they believed had been jettisoned by a passing container ship, the MSC Oriane, travelling to Holland from Brazil. (The Oriane continued on; no trace of drugs were found on it. )  How close these two vessels came has been hotly disputed, and at trial, one expert witness said he couldn’t help but be “amused” by the prosecution’s claims. Anyone on the Oriane, travelling at 18 knots, would have risked ripping the holdalls apart if they chucked £53m of cocaine into the sea. And on the Galwad, in the pitch black, in high winds, on rough seas, retrieving even one holdall in three and a half minutes would have been “virtually impossible”.  
Green’s 39ft fishing boat, the Galwad-y-Mor.  Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian   In any case, the Galwad eventually headed back towards the island. That Sunday was clear and bright. The boat stayed out all day – in full view of bank holiday crowds, plus two police officers on Tennyson Down, a grassy chalk cliff with panoramic sea views. Shortly before the Galwad arrived back in Yarmouth, these police officers radioed in an entry: “SU116 (the Galwad’s ID number) is moving westbound, six to seven items overboard at intervals.” Green has claimed that, if these “items overboard” were anything, they were old bait and waste; the crew may have been clearing the boat at the end of the trip, though he doesn’t recall doing so.  On arrival in Yarmouth, baskets of lobster in their arms, they were arrested and the boat seized. Police were so certain drugs were on board that Green’s original charge sheet cited “possession and intent to supply”. The Galwad was searched and partly dismantled. Its tank was pumped, an itemiser – a highly sensitive piece of police equipment – scanned every inch of the boat, but no molecule of cocaine was found.  The following morning, Monday 31 May, a lobster fisherman found 11 holdalls, each stacked with cocaine, strung together on a rope attached to a weighted buoy in Freshwater Bay. (It was an area too shallow for the Galwad to have reached, but the prosecution claimed the holdalls may have drifted.)         The police told me I didn’t have to be in prison, I could have a new identity – but I told them I didn’t know anything       This is where the investigation gets contentious. The court heard that on the Monday morning, in a police operation debrief, substantial amendments were made to the police log – so many that they became longer than the log itself. (In court, the log keeper claimed her radio had stopped working during the operation, which meant much had been missed.) The most critical amendment, and the only direct evidence linking the men to the drugs, was made by the two police officers from Tennyson Down. Contrary to strict protocol, they didn’t attend the debrief, but made this amendment when they met the surveillance commander in a car park. It read: “The items appeared to be dark in colour and approximately the size of a large holdall. They were tied together on a line and were dispatched from the boat one after another, totalling 10-12. The last item was a red floating buoy.”  Had Green really deposited this enormous haul of cocaine when it was clear and sunny, in a bay where the shore and cliffs were heaving with people? Would an experienced fisherman leave the bags floating and drifting instead of carefully anchored and submerged? And having witnessed such a suspicious deposit, would police leave these items in the sea all night without even taking a photograph or noting the GPS? (In court, one of the police officers claimed they didn’t have a camera.)  No more evidence emerged. There were satellite calls made on the Galwad at sea that Saturday night – but their content is unknown. Although the cocaine was damp, suggesting leakage, no traces were found on the boat. And though a guilty plea would have substantially reduced their sentences, all five insisted they were innocent. Before the trial, police visited Payne in Parkhurst prison, offering freedom in exchange for information, but Payne insisted he had nothing to give. “My girlfriend had split up with me. They knew I was struggling,” he says. “They told me I didn’t have to be there, I could go wherever I wanted, I could have a new identity – but I told them I didn’t know anything. That fishing trip was your normal bloody nightmare like every other fishing trip.”  Perhaps the figure most tenuously linked to all this was the fifth man, Jon Beere, who was arrested eight months later, then tried and convicted alongside the Galwad crew. Beere was 42, married for 18 years to Sue, a special needs support worker, and father of Elle, Maisie and Flynn. He ran a scaffolding business and though, according to Sue, Beere and Green weren’t close, they’d known each other for years “as everyone on the island is connected”.  
Sue Beere, the wife of Jonathan Beere, one of the convicted men, with Maisie and Flynn, two of their three children.  Photograph: Peter Flude/The Guardian   For nine years, Sue has raised their children without Beere. “When it happened, Jon had a scaffolding job on the harbourmaster’s building in Yarmouth, right by Jamie’s boat,” she says. The case against Beere is that, on Friday 28 May, the day before the fishing trip, he’d taken his distinctive pick-up on the hovercraft to Portsmouth, where he met Dresic, and delivered him, along with two associates who were helping him as they spoke English, to Green. The defence claimed that Green had been at sea, unable to collect this potential crew member, so he’d called Beere from his boat and asked him to do it as a favour. This was the extent of the case against the scaffolder.  “The biggest joke is that for doing that, he was the land-based criminal mastermind, the ‘organiser’,” Sue says. The prosecution failed to produce any phone records, emails, texts or other lines of communication between Beere and whoever was supplying the drugs from abroad, or any other network, other than these two men. “Jon’s the most disorganised person I know,” Sue continues. “His filing system is Tesco bags tied with a knot, or telephone numbers scribbled on scraps of paper. He used to drive his poor secretary round the twist. Jon was very much part of the community – he’d do anything for anyone. He wouldn’t just give you a lift, he’d lend you his car. He was a decent bloke. I talk like he’s dead! But it’s so hard, because every aspect of life hasn’t been the same since.”  ***  The Freshwater Five’s trial took place in Kingston upon Thames, Soca’s home turf, though the defence team had pushed for it to be held locally, or somewhere jurors might understand conditions at sea. “Despite that, we still went into it believing it would all be resolved, that in a minute someone would see sense,” Nicky Green says. “You’re in this arena, you don’t know the rules, and you don’t see the steam train coming at you.” Although the judge’s final summary appeared to pour doubt on much of the evidence – referring to the “large number of additions and alterations” to the police log and the “extraordinary” account from Tennyson Down – the jury reached a guilty verdict with a majority of 11 to one.         If it was a year in prison, I’d have been devastated, but 24? How could I tell the children? How was I going to cope?       “It was like one of those films where the whole tone changes, like someone has flicked a switch,” Nicky says. “There was this huge rush of emotion. Sue was howling. Nikki was howling. You’re picking up all these broken people around you.”  The sentences followed that same day, the harshest reserved for Green, Beere and Dresic, who were seen as more deeply involved. “I remember hearing ‘24 years’,” Sue says. “It’s such a huge number. If it had been a year, I’d have been devastated, but 24? How was I going to tell the children? How was I going to cope? What about the business? What about the house? What about… us?”  How has she coped? “I don’t know how I’ve got through it, if I’m honest,” she says. “Support, love, family, friends – and believing in Jon. My dad does the ‘blue jobs’ – splitting the wood, fixing the car. My mum has been amazing with the children.  “When Jon was arrested, our eldest was doing her GCSEs and our youngest was still in playschool. He’s missed Elle getting her GCSE results, he’s missed the birth of Willow, his first grandchild. He’s missed two graduations. Maisie’s first communion. Flynn’s first day at primary. His last day at primary. Jon has never seen Flynn play football, and Flynn’s in the top team on the island. He missed his best friend’s funeral last year. Births, marriages, deaths. Everything.”  Jamie Green has also missed family milestones. His children have grown up, begun work, had children. One daughter now runs a local crab business (We’ve Got Crabs) and his son, just 13 when Green was arrested, is now a North Sea skipper. Their mother Nikki died of cancer four years into Green’s sentence. For 18 months, she was too sick to make the journey from Yarmouth to HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire – though Green was allowed to visit her once in a hospice. He also attended her funeral, handcuffed to a guard.  “There were about 700 people there and every one of them tried to hug him,” Nicky says. “Fair play to the prisoner officer – he did his best to get out the way, with arms flying everywhere.” Green also gave the eulogy with the guard crouched behind the podium. Green has said that when his voice started to falter, the guard quietly urged him on, and told him he could do it.  ***  The appeal has given some hope to the families. It’s being fought by Emily Bolton, the English lawyer who founded the Innocence Project New Orleans (which has exonerated 36 people to date) and is now director of  Appeal . For Bolton, working in the UK has been a shock. “It’s far slower, there’s less access to information, no one picks up the phone, there’s no sense of urgency,” she says. “In the US, we got someone out in one year – I’ve been working on this case for six.”         This has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify that, but even if I clear my name, I’ll have the stigma       One piece of evidence that Bolton had been requesting since 2014 – and that forms the basis of this appeal – finally arrived at the end of 2019. It involves the digital data taken from the onboard computer of the police cutter that was tracking the Galwad that night. The data had reportedly not been disclosed or used at trial, but shows two things. One is that in the shipping lanes around the time of the “handover”, the Oriane was heading south, moving further from the Galwad than had been suggested in court.  More significantly for Bolton, back at Freshwater Bay at the time of the “deposit”, it showed a mystery vessel heading towards the exact location where the drugs were later found, after the Galwad had passed through the area. “That was either the ultimate suspect panicking and dumping the drugs because police were everywhere, or a police boat going to search the area the Galwad had left and finding nothing,” Bolton says. “Either of those should have been disclosed at trial – and if it had been, I’ve no doubt the men would not have been convicted.”  She’s cautiously optimistic. “I think the evidence is strong,” she says. “It’s digital, not something subject to human interference – but that doesn’t mean I don’t wake up at 4am worrying about it. The families have been through so much, the idea that we might lose is absolutely chilling.”

During Sue Beere’s most recent prison visit, her husband said that perhaps, with luck, this would be one of the last times she’d have to make the journey. But Birtwistle and Payne have lower expectations. “This has destroyed a big part of my life and I want to rectify what’s wrong,” Birtwistle says, “but even if I clear my name, I’ll always have the stigma.” Payne abandoned hope years ago. “It was not doing me any good mentally,” he says. “If you continue to think about it, you’d go mad. I’ve got no faith in the system any more, no faith whatsoever – and when I accepted that, it just got easier.”  • This article was amended on 20 April 2020 to add Emily Bolton’s current role as director of Appeal.   

The Conservative former immigration minister Caroline Nokes has accused the  Home Office  of using barracks accommodation for asylum seekers to make the country appear to them “as difficult and inhospitable as possible”.  She said asylum seekers should not be “segregated into a ghetto” in barracks accommodation, but instead placed in supported accommodation where they have access to a range of facilities.    Nokes is among a group of backbench Conservative MPs with barracks in their constituencies who have raised concerns about their use to house asylum seekers. Others include Damian Collins, whose Folkestone and Hythe constituency includes  Napier barracks , and Richard Fuller, the MP for North East Bedfordshire, where there is a new barracks-style development close to Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre.  There is growing concern about the conditions inside the barracks. Inhabitants say they are freezing cold and filthy, with poor quality drinking water and food so bad they refuse to eat it. There have been   Covid outbreaks, hunger strikes and suicide attempts.  The decision to hold several hundred asylum seekers in the barracks has triggered a raft of legal actions as well as outcry from human rights charities including the Red Cross, Care4Calais, Detention Action and Medical Justice.  Military barracks in remote locations have never before been used to accommodate asylum seekers, many of whom have survived torture and other forms of persecution before fleeing their home countries. Some of those tortured in military or prison facilities at home have said the barracks have triggered nightmares and flashbacks.  “We as a nation can do better than this,” said Nokes, who was immigration minister in Theresa May’s government between January 2018 and July 2019. “The Home Office really needs to get its act together. They need to revamp the accommodation contracts and put in place more contracts for supported accommodation.  She has been vocal about her concerns not only about Home Office plans to establish barracks-style accommodation on Ministry of Defence land in her own constituency of Romsey and Southampton North, but also about wider barracks policy and the approach to asylum seekers.  “I don’t think the Home Office is listening to me. I think they have become very blinkered,” she said. “Barracks are not a short-term quick fix. They have failed.”  She said she was surprised that the Home Office was moving forward with barracks plans while a handful of legal actions were under way to challenge their use.  “Is now the time to introduce even worse accommodation when we don’t know what the outcome of the legal challenges will be? Better to hold fire until such time as we have seen the outcome. That doesn’t appear to be the Home Office strategy,” she said.  It is understood that the use of one barracks-style accommodation, an  officers’ mess  at RAF Coltishall in Norfolk, is winding down. Around 40 asylum seekers are accommodated there.  The Conservative MP for Broadland, Jerome Mayhew, said the community had been taken by surprise when the Home Office moved asylum seekers in there last May, but had been supportive.  “Whilst the centre is undoubtedly well run, it is generally accepted that its rural location makes it unfit for anything but emergency use as an asylum centre, so I am glad that the Home Office has committed to closing the facility as soon as the Covid crisis is past,” Mayhew said.  At least five legal challenges are under way – two relating to Penally barracks in Wales, two relating to Napier barracks in Folkestone, and one relating to Yarl’s Wood.  They focus on the lawfulness or otherwise of providing such accommodation for asylum seekers, breach of asylum seekers’ human rights, false imprisonment, deprivation of liberty, and failure to conduct vulnerability assessments.  Sue Willman, of Deighton Pierce Glynn, who is representing several asylum seekers at Napier barracks, said: “We have issued a judicial review against the home secretary challenging her decision to detain three asylum-seeker clients, each of whom is either a victim of torture or trafficking or both.”  Toufique Hossain, director of public law at Duncan Lewis solicitors, which is bringing legal challenges at Napier and Penally, said: “The government’s strategy to segregate asylum seekers in collective ex-military/detention sites across rural and remote parts of England and Wales is yet another feature of its harsh, dehumanising immigration policy.  “Our clients have been subjected to detention and interrogation in their countries. They have fled having experienced rape, sexual abuse and torture. These military camps are obviously retraumatising.”  The immigration compliance minister, Chris Philp, said: “These sites were previously used to house military personnel – to suggest they are not good enough for asylum seekers is an insult. They are provided with three meals a day, and have their basic needs catered for.  “The damage and destruction at Napier Barracks put lives at risk, including staff and emergency service workers. This is totally unacceptable and I would like to thank the police and fire service officers who had to put themselves in harms’ way.”    

Children and vulnerable adults are still being forced by gangs to travel from cities to towns and villages as part of “county lines” drug trafficking, according to the head of a police taskforce set up to tackle the problem. 
Det Supt Gareth Williams, head of intelligence and covert policing at British Transport  Police  (BTP), told the Guardian the restrictions on public transport during the coronavirus lockdown had not resulted in a reduction in the number of mostly juvenile drug runners identified across the country. 
County lines  involves gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool using children as young as 11 to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones in smaller towns and rural areas across the country. 
The National Crime Agency revealed this month that more than 3,000 unique “deal lines” were identified in 2019, of which 800 to 1,100 were estimated to be active during any given month. That is a 50% increase on the 2,000 identified in 2018.

What does the term ‘county lines’ mean? 
The name ‘county lines’ refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones_to smaller towns and rural areas. 
Who are the victims and how are they recruited? 
The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted.  
Many victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation. 
How big is the problem? 
In 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf._ 
No one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records – known as ‘clean skins’ – are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children’s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children’s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs. 
How many children have been affected 
The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 – nearly three times the 720 previously established.  Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making £800,000 profits in a year. 
The Children's Commissioner estimates at least 46,000 children in England are caught up in gangs.

Despite the drug runners being heavily dependent on the rail network, in the last week the BTP county lines taskforce has made 10 county lines arrests and seized two consignments of drugs, three lots of weapons and £8,000 in cash. 
Among the arrests made since lockdown conditions were imposed on 23 March was that of a 16-year-old girl in Preston who was found to have a sizeable quantity of cash. 
The activity, which Williams said was reflective of a typical week for the taskforce, is set against the backdrop of a 94% reduction in rail travel. “We’ve not seen a reduction,” Williams said of county lines activity in the lockdown period. “But the reduction in train services and the requirement to have an essential purpose for your journey is making it incredibly easy for us. If you’ve got a 15-year-old from London in Bournemouth in the afternoon but he hasn’t got an essential purpose, then they are easy to spot.” 
The taskforce was established in December after receiving a £1m government grant to tackle county lines drug trafficking. Williams set up a dedicated team of 35 staff across London and south-east England, Birmingham and the north-west. 
Williams said that while those in the team were based in major drug “export” locations, they had been deployed to unexpected areas to tackle the problem, including Colwyn Bay, Skegness, Telford, Basingstoke and Shrewsbury. 
In its first four months the taskforce has been involved in 272 arrests, 145 seizures of drugs, including class A substances, and the confiscation of £108,000. 
The Covid-19 lockdown was expected to hit county lines gangs’ chosen method of distributing drugs across the country – that of forcing young people to carry them by public transport. But despite coaches no longer running and some hire car companies providing vehicles only for essential journeys, BTP is still identifying runners and victims of exploitation on the rail network. 
“Our ambition before this became well known was to stop the railway network from being the option of choice for criminal gangs to use people. If we succeed in that, then at the very least we’re moving our demographic from ages 14, 15 up to 18, 19, 20 – people who can hire cars,” said Williams. 
He said he expected restrictions on international travel to lead to a slowdown in the supply of illicit drugs, which will have a knock-on effect on prices and in turn could raise the risk of violence. 
Meanwhile, Nottinghamshire police have said the lockdown measures made it easier to spot drug dealers in the community, with neighbours reporting large numbers of people visiting certain properties for short periods of time. 
Det Supt Mike Allen, of the force’s serious organised crime unit, told the  Nottingham Post : “These citizens used to be at work in the day and did not see what was going on in their community, but now they suspect. Drug dealers rely on hiding in plain sight, but because of lockdown these tactics do not work and pose a problem. They do not have that luxury any more.” 
He added that officers had been redeployed from roles such as policing city centre streets over the weekend to help the department out, while quieter roads had given them the opportunity to catch more dealers attempting to transport drugs in and out of the county. 

The killing of George Floyd by a white police officer took place thousands of miles away in the US, but his cries that he could not breathe, in a distressing video that was  seen across the world , resonated deeply with people in the UK. 
The extent of that feeling is revealed in an exclusive Guardian analysis, which has identified 260 towns and cities that held protests in June and early July – from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. 
Within days of  Floyd’s death , the protests in the UK had begun. The thousands that marched in central London under the banner of Black Lives Matter on the weekend of 29 May would be the first of several anti-racism rallies during lockdown. Many who wanted to take part, but could not travel to the capital because of the coronavirus pandemic, mobilised locally instead. 
Approximately 15,000 people marched in Manchester on 6 June, one of 160 protests that weekend. This included a gathering of 6,000 demonstrators in Cambridge and 10,000 in Bristol, where they  toppled a statue of the 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston . 
By mid-June,  more than 210,000 people  had attended demonstrations around the country, including 10,000 protesters in Brighton, 4,000 in Birmingham and 3,000 in Newcastle. 
The Black Lives Matter campaign was the largest seen in the UK since the slave abolition movement 
“The current anti-racism protests are unprecedented in my lifetime and probably the largest ever since that late 18th and early 19th centuries,” said Prof Hakim Adi, the first person of African heritage to become a professor of history in Britain.  
The Chichester-based academic described the campaign for the end of the slave trade as the biggest political movement in Britain’s history. Michael Biggs, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Oxford, agreed. 
He said: “The BLM protests are certainly the largest anti-racist demonstrations in Britain in the 21st or 20th century. They have exceeded the preceding wave of mobilisation in the late 1970s, when perhaps 80,000 people attended the  Rock Against Racism  concert in London’s Victoria Park. However, it shouldn’t be forgotten that in 1833 1.3 million Britons signed petitions to abolish slavery. Adjusting for population growth, that would be today’s equivalent of 5 million.” 
The push for abolition inspired widespread mass protests and petitions across the country. More than 500 petitions were presented to parliament in 1791-92, representing nearly all the large towns and cities. 
Adi said: “I can’t think of anything similar. Certainly in my lifetime I’ve not seen anything like this. What’s significant about it is not only are a lot of black people involved, these protests have also taken place in towns and places where there aren’t any black people or very few. We’re seeing many citizens coming out to protest.” 
The map, above, is a snapshot of the protests from June to the first weeks of July, using data the Guardian collated from local news sources. The protests are ongoing: the All Black Lives collective has vowed to protest every Sunday in central London until its demands are met.

A teenage girl has been arrested over the murder of a man in West Sussex.  Emergency services were called to Russell Way in Three Bridges, Crawley, at 9pm on Tuesday where they found a 24-year-old man with serious injuries, Sussex police said in a statement.    Despite being treated by paramedics and an air ambulance doctor, he died at the scene.  Police said a 14-year-old girl from Crawley was arrested in south London around 10.20pm on Wednesday on suspicion of murder.  A 21-year-old man from London was also arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.  Anyone with information is asked to report online at sussex.police.uk or call 101 quoting Operation Parkhead.   

Police are appealing for witnesses after the death of a 15-year-old girl in a speedboat accident near  Southampton .  Eleven other people were injured when the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) hit a buoy in difficult conditions on the Solent on Saturday.    The girl who died was named in reports as Emily Lewis, from Park Gate near Southampton. Her father, Simon, who was also on the vessel with his wife, Nikki, and Emily’s 19-year-old sister, Amy, paid tribute on Sunday to his “beautiful daughter”.  He wrote on Facebook: “Nikki and I need to share some very tragic news today. Our beautiful daughter Emily passed away yesterday.  “We were all involved in a boating accident in the Solent and Em suffered serious trauma and died not long after we got to hospital.  “Nikki and Amy suffered broken arms and are doing as well as expected. I have pain but no breaks but the emotional pain far outweighs the physical.  “We are all in shock that our beautiful daughter and sister is no longer with us and words just don’t seem to be available to express our deep sense of loss.”  Det Supt Neil Corrigan of Hampshire constabulary said: “This was a tragic incident and our thoughts remain with the young girl’s family at this difficult time. We are now building a picture of what happened on the water that day and the circumstances leading up to this collision. It is important that we gather as much visual evidence as we can, as well as accounts from any witnesses.”  The condition of the other passengers is unknown. Police said all required medical treatment and some were seriously injured. A spokesman for the South Central ambulance service said none of the survivors’ injuries were life-threatening.  Police, who are working with the Maritime _ Coastguard Agency and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch, declined to name the owners of the RIB but confirmed it had been on a commercial trip run by a local company.  Detectives are appealing for witnesses and video footage from people who may have been out on the water or seen the incident from a ferry heading to the Isle of Wight at the time.  The crash happened shortly after 10am on Saturday between Netley Abbey and Hythe Pier. Corrigan appealed for information from anyone who was on a ferry that left Southampton at 10am heading to East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, and anyone else who might have been on the water at the time.  A local mariner told PA Media that navigation markers in the Solent were usually very large and could be the size of a small car. He said conditions had been very difficult on Saturday, with strong spring tides coupled with winds of 8 on the Beaufort scale – up to 46mph.  Anyone with information is asked to contact police on 101 quoting Operation Orange, or to submit information and visually recorded evidence via the  major incident public portal .   

A vulnerable and impressionable 16-year-old girl was “cruelly and brutally” murdered by her aunt’s husband in a sexually motivated attack, a jury has been told.  The attack on Louise Smith by Shane Mays was so violent that she was left unrecognisable, the court heard.    Mays, 30, of Havant, Hampshire, allegedly tried to burn his victim’s body, which was found 13 days after she went missing on 8 May.  The jury at Winchester crown court has been told Mays has admitted manslaughter but denies murder.  James Newton-Price QC, prosecuting, said Louise, who aspired to be a veterinary nurse, began living with Mays and his wife, Chazlynn Jayne Mays, known as CJ, two weeks before she was killed.  She moved into their one-bedroomed flat after quarrelling in April with her mother, Rebecca Cooper, because she wanted to spend more time with her boyfriend.   Mays “tickled” and had “playfights” with Louise and “flirted” with her by putting his arm around her and pinning her down, the court heard.  On 8 May, the defendant allegedly led the college student to a woodland site, Havant Thicket, and murdered her.  Newton-Price said: “The prosecution submits this is a cruel and brutal murder. A determined attempt had been made to destroy her body, which was so badly burned and damaged by fire as to be unrecognisable.  “Her body has been subjected to extreme violence and violation, including repeated and heavy blows to her head. Her body had also been penetrated in a terrible way … there are grounds to believe that part of the motivation for her murder was sexual.”  Louise initially got on well with Mays and his wife, the court heard. She even messaged Chazlynn Jayne Mays, saying: “I wish you and Shane was my parents.” But the relationship quickly soured and she messaged a friend: “They are just vile.”  On the night before her death, Louise was drinking heavily and contacted a mental health hotline.  Friends of Louise, whose body was found on 21 May, said she was easily led and vulnerable to peer pressure.  Newton-Price QC said: “Louise was a vulnerable child. She took anti-depressants and occasionally self-harmed and had a social worker. She lacked self-confidence and she suffered from the anxiety issues that affect some teenagers. Louise wanted to assert her independence but we submit she was vulnerable and impressionable.”  The trial continues.      

A coroner has made legal history by ruling that air pollution was a cause of the death of a nine-year-old girl.  Philip Barlow, the inner south  London  coroner, said Ella Kissi-Debrah’s death in February 2013 was caused by acute respiratory failure, severe asthma and air pollution exposure.     He said she was exposed to nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter (PM) pollution in excess of World Health Organization guidelines, the principal source of which were traffic emissions.  The coroner said the failure to reduce pollution levels to legal limits possibly contributed to her death, as did the failure to provide her mother with information about the potential for air pollution to exacerbate asthma. 
Ella Kissi-Debrah: how a mother’s fight for justice may help prevent other air pollution deaths  
Read more        “Ella died of asthma contributed to by exposure to excessive air pollution,” said the coroner on Wednesday.  He said that during Ella’s life, nitrogen dioxide emissions in Lewisham, where she lived, exceeded legal limits, both EU and national levels. Particulate matter levels were above the WHO guidelines, he said.  “The whole of Ella’s life was lived in close proximity to highly polluting roads. I have no difficulty in concluding that her personal exposure to nitrogen dioxide and PM was very high.”  The coroner said the health effects of air pollution had been known for many years, and children and those with asthma were particularly at risk.  He found that air pollution both induced and exacerbated Ella’s particular form of severe asthma.  The ruling is the first of its kind in the UK and is likely to increase pressure on the government to tackle illegal levels of air pollution across the country.

Photograph: Kirsty O’Connor/PA   Ella’s mother, Rosamund Kissi-Debrah, a former teacher,  spent years fighting to have her daughter’s death examined by a second coroner . Her resilience was repaid on Wednesday when Barlow agreed with expert medical evidence provided by the family which said Ella’s particular form of acute asthma was exacerbated by air pollution.  Kissi-Debrah’s lawyers submitted that air pollution was a public health emergency and there was a pressing need for it to be recorded as a cause of death to ensure public health programmes to tackle toxic air were prioritised.  In evidence to the two-week inquest, Prof Stephen Holgate, an immunopharmacologist and consultant respiratory physician of the University of Southampton and Southampton general hospital, said a biological cause of Ella’s disease getting worse in the winter months was the seasonal worsening air pollution.  He said it was the cumulative effect of the toxic air Ella was breathing in living within 30 metres of the South Circular road that caused her final acute asthma attack.  Holgate said Ella was  like a canary in a coalmine , signalling the risk to other Londoners from the toxic mix of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides in the air.  Ella had had numerous seizures and been taken to hospital almost 30 times in the three years before her death.  An inquest ruling from 2014, which found that she died of acute respiratory failure, was quashed by the high court following new evidence about the dangerous levels of air pollution close to her home.  
A family photo of Ella Kissi-Debrah, front.  Photograph: Claire Cox/PA   During the hearing, Holgate, who was a member of the royal commission for environmental pollution until it was closed in 2011, heavily criticised the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Department of Health and Social Care for failing to work together on toxic air.  Ella’s family argued there was sufficient evidence to conclude there were failures by the state to take steps to protect the public from dangerous levels of air pollution, which amounted to a violation of article 2 of the Human Rights Act, concerning the right to life.  The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said the coroner’s conclusion was a “landmark moment” and called pollution a “public health crisis”.  “Today must be a turning point so that other families do not have to suffer the same heartbreak as Ella’s family. Toxic air pollution is a public health crisis, especially for our children, and the inquest underlined yet again the importance of pushing ahead with bold policies such as expanding the ultra low emission zone to inner London.”  “Ministers and the previous mayor have acted too slowly in the past, but they must now learn the lessons from the coroner’s ruling and do much more to tackle the deadly scourge of air pollution in London and across the country.”  A government spokesperson said: “Our thoughts remain with Ella’s family and friends.  “We are delivering a £3.8bn plan to clean up transport and tackle NO2 pollution, and going further in protecting communities from air pollution, particularly PM2.5 pollution, which we know is particularly harmful to people’s health. Through our landmark environment bill, we are also setting ambitious new air-quality targets, with a primary focus on reducing public health impacts.”   

Parts of  Scotland  and southern England experienced transport disruption and multiple flood warnings on Saturday morning following heavy rainfall.  While Friday brought  “thundersnow”  to some parts of Scotland, and other parts of the UK woke up to wintry scenes, Saturday’s forecast featured more rain.    National Rail reported flooding on some of its Scottish routes, including trains through Livingston North, west of Edinburgh. The Scottish capital also reduced its tram services following the heavy rain.  In  England , the Environment Agency warned that flooding was expected across 11 locations including Cambridgeshire and Scarborough, and informed residents that “immediate action” was required. In Cambridgeshire, Huntingdon Racecourse announced races would be cancelled on Saturday after track and facilities flooded.  However, by the afternoon, just one flood warning remained in Swanage, Dorset, which had 31mm of rainfall in six hours. There were also 46 flood alerts in force, meaning that flooding was “possible” and residents should “be prepared”.  A yellow weather warning, which indicates a risk of flooding to some homes and businesses and possible transport disruptions, was also in place over Marlborough, Salisbury, Southampton and parts of Winchester following heavy rain on Saturday morning. According to Steven Keates, an operational meteorologist at the Met Office, those areas saw rainfall of between 25 and 30mm.  Until Saturday afternoon, a yellow weather warning was also in place in areas of north-east Scotland, including Inverness and Aberdeen, which had been expected to get 40mm of rainfall.  Keates said Drumnadrochit on the shores of Loch Ness had been “the wettest place in the last 24 hours”, recording 48.6mm of rain.  The cold weather is set to continue over the weekend, with the Met Office forecasting that temperatures will remain in single digits and icy conditions are likely to persist until Tuesday.  “In summary, it’s a bit messy this weekend. It’s staying cold, gradually becoming a bit drier and we’ll switch our attention to some overnight frost, and I think tomorrow morning will see some dense freezing fog patches in places,” said Keates.  Thursday night was the coldest night of the winter so far, with the mercury dropping to -9.6C (14.7F) at Altnaharra, Sutherland, in the Highlands. Many residents of Edinburgh contacted emergency services after being woken in the early hours of Friday morning by loud explosions, which were caused by thundersnow. The phenomenon is caused when thunderstorms form in wintry conditions, and produce heavy snowfall.  Keates said Friday’s snowfall was likely to have been “the most widespread snow of the season so far”.  However, temperatures are yet to top those seen on 13 February, which was the coldest night of 2020 so far. Temperatures of -10.2C (13.6F) were recorded at Braemar in Aberdeenshire.  • This article was amended on 7 December 2020 to remove text incorrectly implying that Edinburgh has more than one tram route. In addition, not all of the 11 locations in England that the Environment Agency warned to expect flooding were in the south as an earlier version said.   

England  Groups of up to six people can  meet outside from Monday  in public and private outdoor spaces, including gardens. Physical distancing including staying 2 metres apart must be observed if those meetings involve members of different households.    People are only allowed to be inside the homes of friends and families in order to access gardens.  Some schools will reopen to some pupils from Monday, with nurseries, reception, year 1 and year 6 leading the way. On 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12.  Outdoor retail spaces can reopen on Monday, followed by other non-essential retail outlets on 15 June.  A government easing of lockdown rules since the middle of May has meant outdoor exercise has been encouraged, as long as physical distancing is respected and activities occur only with a maximum of one other person from another household.  Those who can work from home have meanwhile been told to continue to do so, but those who cannot have been told to travel, while avoiding public transport if they can.  
Nicola Sturgeon has kept the ‘stay at home’ message.  Photograph: Scottish Government/AFP/Getty Images   Scotland  Scotland’s first minister,  Nicola Sturgeon , confirmed at her daily press briefing on Thursday that she would proceed with phase 1 of the Scottish government’s four-stage plan for moving out of lockdown, while insisting that the stay-at-home message remained core to new guidance.  From Friday, Scots will be able to meet with  members of one other household . This must happen outdoors, in parks or private gardens, and while observing social distancing, and the total number of people meeting should be a maximum of eight. There is also a strong recommendation not to meet more than one other household per day. People will be allowed to travel – preferably by walking or cycling – for recreation or visits, with a suggested limit of five miles, although Sturgeon has said that people should “use their judgment”. Sitting or sunbathing in parks will be permitted, as will many outdoor non-contact sports including golf, fishing, tennis and bowls.  In terms of business, most outdoor work that has been put on hold can resume. Garden centres and recycling facilities are also allowed to reopen, while takeaway and drive-through food outlets will no longer be discouraged. From Monday, teachers can return to schools to prepare for the start of the new school year on 11 August, when pupils will begin a “blended” model of at home and in school learning. From Wednesday, child minding services and fully outdoor nurseries will begin to reopen.   
The beach at Llandudno, Wales, on Wednesday.  Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Reuters   Wales_  On bank holiday Monday, Welsh beaches were the quietest they had been in years compared with English coastal resorts. Places such as Barry Island were virtually deserted in contrast to packed beaches on the English south coast including Bournemouth and Brighton. This was because  Wales  is still operating arguably the strictest lockdown policy of all the nations of the UK.  While Welsh restrictions have eased, such as through the reopening of gardening and recycling centres, the central message from the Cardiff devolved government has been to “stay local”, unlike elsewhere where day trips anywhere in the country are now permitted. While  Boris Johnson  has announced the opening of non-essential retail shops by mid-June, the Wales health minister, Vaughan Gething, stated this week that his country could continue its “cautious approach’” to lifting the lockdown, signalling that Welsh high streets may open later than in England.

Photograph: Charles McQuillan/Getty Images   Northern Ireland  Northern Ireland plans to allow small outdoor weddings and some outdoor retailers to open from 8 June.  It will mark the second phase of a five-phase plan to lift the region’s lockdown. On 18 May garden and recycling centres were allowed to open, a cautious approach that continued with Thursday’s announcement about phase 2.  Authorities signalled a green light for car showrooms, furniture shops, agricultural machinery, dog-grooming parlours and outdoor weddings with no more than 10 people. Hotels will be allowed to take bookings but have no date for their reopening.  The first minister,  Arlene Foster , said the Stormont executive would confirm the relaxation after it had met again on 4 June. The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium called Thursday’s announcement a welcome first step.   

Women may well feel free to propose to their partners any day of the week these days, but the Irish tradition of female proposals on Leap Day is in full swing after a man was left “gobsmacked” when his girlfriend popped the question 450ft above  Brighton  beach.  “It was 9am and a leap year so Bobby didn’t hang about,” said lighting designer Steve Haw, who described how they had ascended the British Airways i360 observation tower next to Brighton Pier before legal secretary Bobby Davison popped the question early on Saturday.    “I am gobsmacked and really touched that Bobby went to such an effort to bring me to Brighton and propose on the i360. The whole thing just makes me love her even more.”  The couple, who met 13 years ago on an 80s Butlins weekend, were then serenaded by local singer Ella Croucher, who sang James Blunt’s You’re Beautiful, a song close to the couple’s hearts.  “It’s only fitting that an engagement between us would not be your typical proposal,” said Davison.  Meanwhile, thousands of people across the UK who were born on 29 February celebrated their birthday on the actual anniversary of the one-every-four-year occasion.  Doris Cleife, a retired hairdresser who turned 100 on Saturday, has only partied on the day 25 times and will enjoy the day eating biscuits and pate at a soiree with her family before another bash at her care home in Portsmouth.

Photograph: PA   “I think to myself, I never dreamed I would get this far, I lost my mother when she was quite young and my granny died when she was 47 but here we are, and I have a sister who is 98,” she said.  When asked how it feels to only have had 25 birthdays, she said: “I don’t feel any different. I’ve waited all my life to be famous and now it happens like this.”  She said the secret to her longevity was eating well and walking whenever she could. “I have always worked hard, but I did a lot of walking, and I think walking is good for you, it keeps you fit, well at least it did me.”   

D   ozens of A-level students have told the Guardian of their shock and disbelief after receiving grades far lower than they were predicted to get, leaving some in limbo because they are unable to take up a place at university.   Nancy Coldicott, 17, from Leeds

Photograph: Nancy Coldicott   Coldicott said she was in shock after failing one of her  A-levels , meaning she will miss out on a place at York University. She went to Notre Dame sixth form college in Leeds and had been predicted an A in maths and Bs in psychology and further maths. While her maths result was on target, she received a D and a U respectively in the other subjects.  “The worst case scenario I was expecting was ACC,” she said. “My grade average in psychology was B but I did have a few As. In further maths I was averaging a C but got a few Bs. I think it’s disgusting that they’ve given me a fail. It’s made me feel really useless and incapable of achieving grades I know I can get.

I don’t know a single person who’s not disappointed.”  Caldicott said she had not done very well in her mocks. “So there’s no point in me appealing on the basis of the mock grade because that still wouldn’t meet my offer.”  She also criticised the delay in starting the appeal process next week when clearing started on Thursday. “By the time my appeal’s dealt with it might be too late to get a place at York or somewhere else because the places will be gone. And with a U I can’t get a place at another Russell Group University.”  Joshua Reid, 19, from Woking

He was predicted A*AA but his results, which are ABC, fell short. “I’ve spoken to my college and am trying to appeal,” said Reid who studied religious studies, politics and philosophy at A-level.  “Oxford have lowered the offer from AAA to AAB but if the result of the appeal doesn’t come through by September then I will have to apply again. I don’t understand the grading as philosophy is my best subject but I’ve been given a C. I even came out top of the class.”  Reid thinks the process has been a shambles and is concerned that his place at Oxford is “time-limited”. “It’s really stressful to appeal as no one seems to have any idea how long it’s going to take,” he said.  “The government has handled the situation horrifically,” he added. “The way they’ve chopped and changed our results at the last minute is unfair.”  Amelia Pollard-Gunnery, 17, from Chelmsford  
Amelia Pollard-Gunnery.    Pollard-Gunnery, who was predicted to get ABBC, feels that her results of BCCD are not a real indication of what she could have achieved had she sat her exams. “The whole thing has been chaotic and the government is to blame,” she said.  “I go to a comprehensive which has a low school attainment level and is not in the nicest of areas,” she added. “I feel that the government has already assumed that because of these factors it’s unlikely that I would do as well as someone who might go to a private school in a wealthy area.”  Pollard-Gunnery, who studied sociology, English, art and a voluntary extended project qualification at St John Payne Catholic school, said she is now “in limbo” about her place to study law at the University of East Anglia.  She said: “Around 90% of the people in my year group have had their marks downgraded. There’s no sense in what the government has done. It’s like they offered us an olive branch from a tree that’s already dead.”  Niamh Tillings, 18, from Portsmouth

Tillings said: “She’s feeling absolutely gutted. She’s confusingly received an A for her weakest subject, sociology, and Cs for her strongest subjects, politics and economics. Although the teachers are not allowed to say what grades they gave her they have said these results are well below [what was expected].”  She added: “Bristol have confirmed they can do nothing for her. This seemingly fits with disadvantaged areas having results downgraded more heavily. Her future plans are totally smashed. The rug has been pulled out from under this generation.”  Miles Burford, 18, from Norfolk

My son won a Young Black Gifted Award for Academic Achievement with his GCSE results. His centre-assessed grades have been marked down considerably by Ofqual.”  Burford had been predicted an A in PE, a B or an A in psychology and a C in history but got a C, a D and a U. Kylie Burford added: “His school, Notre Dame High in Norwich, told me this morning they have received the lowest set of results in their history this year. Miles was due to play football for Loughborough, and was considered good enough to join their international Futsal team and have the opportunity to represent the country – those opportunities have been whipped away from him by an algorithm.”   

The pilots were to blame for an offshore helicopter crashing into the sea off the coast of Shetland, killing four passengers, an inquiry has found.  The fatal accident inquiry found that the crew of the Super Puma helicopter failed to maintain the correct air speed as they approached Sumburgh airport in August 2013, leading to it  ditching into the sea .    The helicopter, carrying 18 people, capsized a few hundred metres from the coast, leading to a rescue operation involving the RNLI, coastguard, RAF and police.  Three passengers – Duncan Munro, 46, from Bishop Auckland; Sarah Darnley, 45, from Elgin; and George Allison, 57, from Winchester – drowned at the scene. A fourth, Gary McCrossan, 59, from Inverness, had a cardiac arrest in a life raft.  The inquiry heard that a fifth passenger, Sam Bull, took his own life four years later, aged 28, after suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following the crash.  
The four victims (l-r): Duncan Munro, George Allison, Gary McCrossan and Sarah Darnley. A fifth passenger, Sam Bull, took his own life four years later.  Photograph: PA   The sheriff principal Derek Pyle, who led the inquiry in Inverness, said: “This was a dreadful accident with long-term repercussions for the survivors and the families of the deceased which no determination by this court can properly describe.  “I do hope that it has at least assisted in an understanding of what occurred, the reasons for it, and what has been done to ensure so far as practicable that such an accident does not occur again. My condolences go, in particular, to the families of the deceased, including, lest it be forgotten, the family of Mr Bull.”  Survivors told investigators that it seemed like the helicopter suddenly lost power. It had been returning from the Borgsten Dolphin oil platform.  The aircraft’s pilot was Martin Miglans, and his co-pilot was Alan Bell. Pyle said Miglans had a first-class record flying helicopters, but for reasons that remained unexplained, his failure to keep the helicopter at the right speed on its approach contributed to a “perfect storm of circumstances”.  “Plainly there was no neglect,” Pyle said, but he added: “The flight crew of the helicopter failed to maintain the target approach airspeed and the stabilised approach criteria contained in the operator’s operations manual during the latter stages of the non-precision approach to Sumburgh airport.  “This was due to the flight crew not effectively monitoring the helicopter’s flight instruments, thereby allowing the helicopter to enter a critically low energy state resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft.”   

F   or those in any doubt about the lockdown latest, Wednesday’s front pages could not have been clearer. The Daily Telegraph quoted the words of the prime minister: “Our hibernation is beginning to end.” The Mail, under the joyful summary “SUMMER’S BACK ON!”, said “the bustle is coming back”, adding: “Boris unlocks nation and urges: go and enjoy yourself.”   Thursday’s front pages were pretty clear, too. They just took a slightly different view. One paper carried a half-page picture of ant-like sunbathers in Bournemouth with the line “Only mad dogs and Englishmen”. That was the Telegraph.    Another lost its temper, frankly: “One day after PM’s plea for sense: HUMAN TIDE SWAMPS THE BEACH,” it complained. That was the Mail. GET SUMMER OFF AGAIN! would have been simpler.  On Thursday, as the human tide showed no signs of receding, beaches appeared to have become the latest front of the lockdown culture war.  In Bournemouth, overstretched police  declared a major incident  and the council leader, Vikki Slade, said she was “absolutely appalled”.  In Southend, meanwhile, the council leader, Ian Gilbert, warned of antisocial behaviour and littering. While the area was yet to declare a major incident, a heady mix of liberation, anxiety and sunburn made the mood something close to febrile.  
People jump from a jetty into the sea in Southend.  Photograph: John Keeble/Getty Images   Near the pier, where the beach was at its busiest, a helicopter circled overhead. Word went round that it was Sky News, and people started jeering and giving the pilot the finger. It later turned out to be an air ambulance.  Andy was visiting from east London with two housemates. Like almost everyone else, the 27-year-old was reluctant to give his last name for fear of the public shaming that might ensue.  “We’ve not been out of London since lockdown started,” he said. “I’ve not got a garden. We’re not here to do any harm, we’ve got a football and some beers and it’s baking. We’re not hugging anyone.”  Asked if he knew the current official advice, he laughed. “I don’t think anyone’s got a clue.” For the record, as part of a household of three who wore face masks on a train as they made a day trip to a beach, he didn’t appear to be breaking any of it.  Long-lens pictures make the beach look packed, and it was certainly busier than, say,  Barnard Castle  on an Easter Sunday. But walk along the waterfront and even the most adamant stickler for the rules would see a more complicated picture.  While there were definitely anxiety-inducing crowds, most towels and parasols had a small halo around them. Five minutes further along, it was peaceful.

Photograph: Penelope Barritt/Rex/Shutterstock   “We’re down here because it’s so busy down that end,” said another Andy, who had come with his partner, Maddie. “It’s absolutely manic that way,” she agreed.  The couple, who live a 10-minute drive away, were worried about being judged for making the trip – Andy himself thinks things are being relaxed too soon – but said that as much as anything they were seeking a slice of normality.  “But you have to be aware that it’s not exactly normal,” Maddie added. “I don’t think everyone gets that. I think that confusion creates a sense in people that – if the rules don’t make sense, I don’t have to follow them.”  
A quiet spot beside the sea in Southend.  Photograph: Penelope Barritt/Rex/Shutterstock   A couple of roads from the seafront, Stefan, a 45-year-old architect, said he had counted 40 vehicles going down his street during a five-minute phone call. He pointed to research – disputed by the council – suggesting that Southend reached its highest R rate, 1.6, after the May bank holiday.  “It’s just going to happen again,” he said. “Boris Johnson saying you need to man up and encourage the reopening – I’d like him to come down here, see what he thinks of common sense then.”  The problem, according to Robert West, a professor of health psychology at UCL and an attendee of a subgroup of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, is that when the prime minister downgraded already fragile rules to an appeal to the aforementioned common sense, people read it as a free pass.  And, after all, common sense is a loaded term, full of personal associations that get tied up in class and politics and what’s really important. “Common sense is only common in the sense that we ascribe it to ourselves and deny it to other people,” West said.  “And if you say, ‘we’re not out of the woods and I want to be very clear about that’, and also say ‘woohoo, it’s party time and I want to be clear about that’, we will pick up on whatever is most attractive to us.”   In Southend, the heightened temperatures of every kind will continue for at least another day. “The car parks are chockablock,” said Stefan. “And when they go home we’re left with the burned barbecues, the broken bottles, the bins full up, the toilets. The government seems oblivious to what they’ve unleashed. We just want the thunderstorms to come.”   

Offficials failed to capitalise on a  “reachable moment”  with Jaden Moodie, the 14-year-old who was ultimately murdered in gang violence, when he was arrested three months before his death more than 100 miles from his home in possession of 39 wraps of crack cocaine.  Moodie was knocked off his moped and set upon by four youths who stabbed him fatally nine times in January 2019 in the middle of the street in Leyton, east  London .    Poor communication between police forces, delays in processing housing and school applications and weak rules for governing home schooling could have had an impact on his criminal exploitation, said a serious case review by the safeguarding children board of Waltham Forest borough council. 
From the collapse of a happy family to a brutal death: how Jaden Moodie was failed  
Read more        However, it concluded there was no evidence that his murder could have been predicted or whether different responses would have reduced the threat he faced on the day of his death.  A “potentially pivotal event” occurred in October 2018 when Moodie, referred to as Child C in the report, was found in a cuckoo house – a property taken over by drug dealers, often inhabited by a vulnerable tenant – in Bournemouth with a 17-year-old from Waltham Forest.  Dorset police found Moodie at the property in personal possession of 39 wraps of crack cocaine, a mobile phone and £325 in cash. He was suspected to be involved in “county lines” drug dealing. After being interviewed in custody, he was ultimately driven back to his grandmother’s home in Waltham Forest at 3am.  The coordination of services between Bournemouth and London was not as strong as it could have been, the report said, calling this a “reachable moment”, based on a concept in education that describes an unplanned chance for a breakthrough with a child.  “The response to Child C while detained in Bournemouth and then on his return from there in October 2018 did not capitalise on a ‘reachable’ moment for a child who was clearly being criminally exploited, and nor was all the information available from the authorities in Bournemouth transferred to their counterparts in Waltham Forest,” the report said.  “While the importance of maximising the potential of reachable moments in working with children is beginning to be recognised, there is as yet no satisfactory approach to covering the whole country when a child who is exposed to ‘county lines’ style operations is found a distance away from their home and so reachable moments are being missed.”  From 2011 to 2018, Moodie and his family were living in Nottinghamshire. From 2016, he began to have a troubled time at secondary school, leading to suspensions and other disciplinary measures. His mother decided to educate him at home from 2017, and he was then at home for more than a year.  However, by the end of the summer of 2017 these arrangements were beginning to break down, eventually leaving Moodie with a lot of unsupervised time, a pattern that repeated at regular intervals for the rest of his life.  In April 2018, his mother decided to move him to Waltham Forest to live initially with his grandmother while she applied to be rehoused in Waltham Forest from Nottinghamshire.  At the time of his death, the 14-year-old was sleeping on a sofa at his maternal grandmother’s house while his mother, who was staying nearby, pursued the housing application.  The serious case review highlighted other significant concerns. Moodie spent all but three of his last 22 months out of school and for much of this there was limited adult guidance or supervision.  “Time spent out of school, for whatever reason, is recognised to constitute a significant risk to children who are vulnerable to criminal exploitation,” the report added.  The report found that current arrangements governing home education contributed to his vulnerability to criminal exploitation.  There was a delay in processing his mother’s application for a place for Moodie at a Waltham Forest high school in May 2018, the report said.  The initial response to his mother’s application for housing in Waltham Forest was slow and no new action was taken after her request that her request for rehousing be reopened by Waltham Forest in August until the end of October 2018.  The report concluded that this could have had an impact on Moodie’s mother’s ability to exercise parental control and supervision over her son.   

A supermarket worker has been found guilty of murdering his wife and teenage daughter after he slit their throats in a jealous rage because he was losing his “controlling” grip on the family. 
Marcin Zdun killed 40-year-old Aneta and 18-year-old Nikoleta at the family home in Salisbury, Wiltshire, wrongly suspecting they were both having an affair with a supermarket colleague. 
On Thursday, the judge, Mr Justice Chamberlain, adjourned the case for sentencing at Winchester crown court the following day. 
When Zdun was arrested at the scene of the killings in June, police found a folding lock knife in his trouser pocket with blood stains on the blade and handle. 
Jurors heard the 40-year-old believed both his wife and daughter, a student, were having an affair with a man at the Tesco supermarket where he worked. 
He had become increasingly angry and violent towards his wife, a care worker, because she was not cleaning the house or making meals for the family as he demanded. 
Zdun would confiscate her car keys and even disconnect the vehicle’s battery so she could not drive it, even to visit her clients. He also fell out with his daughter after she disobeyed him by getting piercings and tattoos, having turned to her mother for permission instead. 
The prosecution said his family had become terrified of him in the days leading up to the fatal attack and his wife had sent a message to her mother saying: “I don’t want him to kill us, he’s a psycho.” 
Giving evidence in court, Zdun denied “bullying” his wife but admitted she had asked him to leave the family home after he had attacked her in the kitchen. Zdun moved out but armed himself with the knife and went back to kill his wife and daughter. 
Horrified neighbours told the court how Zdun repeatedly plunged the blade into the defenceless pair in their garden, with Aneta desperately trying to save Nikoleta by putting her own body in the way of the blows. 
David Powell said: “There was no humanity in his face whatsoever, just anger – pure anger. I don’t know how you can do that to another human being. His sole purpose was to kill them.” 
Nicholas Haggan QC, prosecuting, suggested to the jury Zdun felt he had lost “his controlling influence over Aneta and Nikoleta” and this “so angered” him that he decided to kill them. 
Aneta’s employer, Wessex Care, paid tribute to her as a “beloved colleague and friend”. The company said she was a “well loved and well known” member of staff who worked in the community team. 

The family of a man who died after appearing on the Jeremy Kyle Show has expressed concern over a lie detector test he took during the programme and the level of support he was given afterwards.  Relatives of Steve Dymond, 63, also suggested at a pre-inquest hearing that footage they had been provided with of the show may have been “polished and edited”.    Dymond, 63, took a lie detector test during the show on 2 May last year in an attempt to convince his fiancee, Jane Callaghan, that he had not been cheating on her. Afterwards, he expressed concern about the possible repercussions of his appearance and rumours that swirled around him. He was found dead at his rented flat in Portsmouth on 9 May.  The hearing at the city’s coroner’s court was told that the cause of Dymond’s death was a morphine overdose and heart condition.  Kyle’s ITV show was axed amid growing scrutiny of the duty of care owed to participants in reality TV shows, and the episode featuring Dymond was not aired.  Lawyers for the family provided written submissions to the Hampshire coroner, Jason Pegg, at the hearing on Friday. Caoilfhionn Gallagher QC, on behalf of Dymond’s family, said there might be criticism of the person who conducted the polygraph test and called for him to be made an interested party, meaning he would have the right to actively participate in the full inquest.  Gallagher told the hearing that the family also wished to learn more about the assessment of participants in the show, the safeguards in place, and the aftercare.  She raised concerns over the footage to which the family had been given access, saying: “The family has concerns that the footage is polished and edited, and does not represent the totality of the footage that would have been recorded on all cameras on the day.”  At a previous hearing, Gallagher described Dymond as “exceptionally vulnerable” and said he had stopped taking prescribed antidepressants in order to take the polygraph test.  She claimed that only 72 hours elapsed between the suggestion of Dymond appearing on the show and the filming, which she said was a “very short” period.  After the recording, Dymond was “put in a homeward-bound taxi within two hours of telling a researcher that he was really upset and that ‘life was nothing without Jane’,” Gallagher alleged.  A further pre-inquest review has been scheduled for 29 and 30 October.   

Britain’s oldest person, Joan Hocquard, who drove ambulances during the second world war, has died aged 112.  Hocquard died at her home in Poole, Dorset, on Saturday. Her nephew, Paul Reynolds, 74, said she had always sought to live life to the full and that she “loved eating butter and cream and didn’t believe in dieting”.    She was born on 29 March 1908, under the reign of Edward VII, the same day as the world’s former oldest man, Bob Weighton, who died in Hampshire in May.  Their final birthday celebrations were held behind closed doors because of the national coronavirus lockdown. The pair also shared a birthday with Alf Smith from St Madoes in Perthshire, who shared the title of Britain’s oldest man with Weighton until his death in 2019 at the age of 111.

Photograph: BNPS   Reynolds described Hocquard as an independent spirit who had refused a card from the Queen on her 100th birthday because “she did not want people to know how old she was”.  Born in Holland Park, west London, Hocquard spent much of her childhood in Kenya, where her father was a colonial officer in charge of shipping on the Great Lakes in east Africa. She later worked as a cook in a French hotel near Geneva in Switzerland, and met her husband, Gilbert, through their shared love of sailing.  During the second world war, she drove ambulances in London before she and Gilbert moved to the south coast of England.  The couple travelled across Europe in a camper van and went on yachting holidays until his death in 1981.  In the late 1980s she met widower Kenneth Bedford, who was 20 years her junior, at the Bournemouth Gramophone Society and they had lived together since in Poole.  She lived “an extraordinary innings and died peacefully in her own home, which is all you could wish for”, said Reynolds. “She was a strong-willed character and loved telling stories about how naughty she was as a schoolgirl.”  The oldest living Briton is now Lilian Priest from Swanage in Dorset, who is 111.   

A man who tortured a woman before slitting her throat has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years after being convicted of murder and arson.  Brendan Rowan-Davies, 29, tied up 27-year-old Kelly-Anne Case at her home in Gosport, Hampshire, then killed her and set fire to her flat. Firefighters found Case’s naked body on her bed.    The defendant shook his head as the jury returned its verdicts at Winchester crown court while gasps and cries of “yes” could be heard from the public gallery.  Sentencing Rowan-Davies to life, the judge, Mr Justice Garnham said the murder had a “sexual sadistic motive” and added: “She was vulnerable and defenceless. She was completely at your mercy and you showed her none.”  Case’s mother, Caroline Tebb, said in a statement read to court that her daughter was “brutally and sadistically taken by a sick, vile excuse of a human being”.  She added: “This oxygen thief has not only deprived me of a daughter but he also took a mother, a sister, an aunt, cousin, granddaughter and friend. Kelly was an attractive, young, straight-talking, independent woman. She will be sadly missed by those who truly knew her.”  William Mousley QC, prosecuting, had told the jury the motive for the attack appeared to be sexual and the defendant had mutilated Case’s body after killing her.  He said the blaze was reported to the emergency services at 8.30am on 30 July last year. Firefighters found fires had been set in the kitchen and living room of the property before discovering the body in the rear bedroom.  
Kelly-Anne Case.  Photograph: Solent News _ Photo Agency/Solent News   Mousley said the victim had been “alone and vulnerable” when she was killed. He said a postmortem showed her throat had been cut several times, which would have caused catastrophic blood loss.  She had eight shallow wounds above the collarbone, a 9cm stab wound to the back of the right shoulder and another 2cm wound.  Mousley said: “These have the appearance of someone wanting to control or coerce or terrify Kelly-Anne, so perhaps she would do what she was being told.”  He said she had also sustained rib fractures that were consistent with CPR. Mousley said: “It could be that the killer did that at some point – if that was a change of heart it came too late after a savage attack.”  Mousley said the defendant had visited Case with a friend, Will Vallender, who was in a sexual relationship with her, during the previous night when they allegedly drank and took cocaine.  He said during the night Rowan-Davies told Case he had “always fancied her”. She laughed it off as a joke before later going to have sex with Vallender in her bedroom.  Mousley said the pair left at 6.25am but the defendant was seen to return to Case’s home about an hour later when he murdered her.  In the witness box, Rowan-Davies told a court he filmed her having sex with his friend but denied murdering her.  The defendant said he left Case’s home with Vallender but later returned alone because he had left his tobacco at her home.  He said that when he went inside and upstairs at the house, a person put a knife to his throat from behind and he saw Kelly dead on her bed with an injury to her throat.  Following the sentencing, senior investigating officer DI Toby Elcock said: “This was a horrific and planned attack on a young woman, and our thoughts remain with Ms Case’s children, friends and family.”   

Landsec , one of Britain’s biggest property companies, has said it plans to sell off almost a third of its £12.8bn property portfolio over the next few years as it looks to focus on growth opportunities in cities.  The property group behind the Trinity Leeds shopping centre and Bluewater in Kent said it intended to sell assets worth around £4bn over four to five years and reinvest the money in new developments.    The firm will sell off some of its hotel and leisure properties and retail parks, areas where it believes it has “little or no competitive advantage”, and will instead focus on a new strategy to develop projects that include a mix of offices, retail stores and homes.  Mark Allan, who joined Landsec as chief executive during the national lockdown in April, said the firm was “setting out a strategy that makes the most of Landsec’s strengths and positions the business for growth”.  Allan highlighted one of its north London shopping centres , the O2 Centre on Finchley Road, as having “significant redevelopment potential, repurposing potential”, such as building new residential buildings on the site.  Landsec reaffirmed its commitment to the capital, despite persistently low footfall in central London because of the absence of office workers and tourists. Central London assets account for almost two-thirds (64%) of Landsec’s portfolio by value.  It said it believed that some of its retail outlets located on the ground floor of London office buildings would recover following the pandemic as they do not face competition from internet retailers.  However, Allan confirmed that Landsec expects rents to fall at its regional shopping centres, in cities and towns from Glasgow and Leeds to Cardiff and Portsmouth. It expects rents to drop by between 20% and 25% from their March levels in order for them to become “sustainable” for tenants.  Allan said the pandemic had “accelerated structural changes which were already under way” in the retail sector.  The firm revealed earlier in October that it had managed to collect  only a third of rent  from its retail tenants five working days after it was due, highlighting the impact of Covid-19 on commercial property firms.  In contrast, it had collected 82% of rental payment from its office tenants, and Landsec said it was not forecasting a fall in office rental values.  The property group highlighted the growth of its retail outlets, including Braintree Village in Essex and Clarks Village in Somerset, which offer shoppers discounted products and are situated in out-of-town locations that are usually reached by car.  Landsec described its retail outlet portfolio as “thriving” and said this part of its portfolio was “growing most strongly and recovering most strongly as we emerge from the pandemic”.  Analysts from the US investment bank JP Morgan Cazenove said they were “disappointed over the lack of detail” provided by Landsec over its new strategy. “Nothing presented today materially changes the group’s near-term fortunes,” they said.   

London  and several other areas in the south-east will this week enter the toughest coronavirus restrictions in order to contain a surging number of Covid infections. 
The capital along with parts of Essex and Hertfordshire will enter tier 3 at 00.01 on Wednesday. Hancock told MPs the data would now be reviewed weekly, with the next review on 23 December. All of Essex, except Tendring, and Watford, Hertsmere and Broxbourne in Hertfordshire will join London in tier 3 restrictions. 
London 
The health secretary, Matt Hancock, briefed London MPs that the capital will enter  tier 3  from Wednesday, after the government’s Covid operations committee met on Monday morning to discuss new tier restrictions. 
Hancock will give a statement in the Commons on Monday afternoon, where he is likely to announce other changes across England.

MPs from London, Essex, Kent and Hertfordshire were briefed on Monday morning and told that increases in infections in some areas were “off the chart”, according to sources in the meeting. 
The latest data showed almost 24,000 confirmed cases in London in a week, and cases rising in every borough.

From 2 December, England will be divided into three different tiers of restrictions. They are slightly amended from the previous system. 
Across all tiers, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector are set to reopen. Collective worship and weddings – with a maximum of 15 in attendance – can also resume. 
Tier one 
Under the new system hospitality businesses in England can stay open until 11pm with table service only but last orders must be made by 10pm, in an effort to stagger departures. The_ “rule of six” _will also remain in place indoors, meaning social household mixing is still allowed. 
Spectator sport is set to resume , albeit with limits on numbers and abiding by social distancing. In tier 1, there will be a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of occupancy of the stadium or 4,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000. 
In tier 1, people will be encouraged to minimise travel and work from home where possible. Support bubbles – which allowed a single household to join with another household – are also being broadened across all tiers. Parents with a child under one will be able to form a support bubble, as well as those with a child under five who needs continuous care, such as a child with a disability. Also, in cases where there is a single adult carer, for a partner with dementia for example, they would also be able to form a support bubble. 
The full government rules and guidance for tier 1 can be found_ here .  
Tier two 
Under the new system, although hospitality venues will be allowed to stay open until 11pm – with last orders at 10pm – only those that serve substantial meals can operate. It means pubs and bars that do not will have to close. 
As before, social mixing outside of households or support bubbles will not be allowed indoors. The rule of six will apply outdoors. 
Spectators will be allowed to watch sport in tier 2, with a maximum crowd capacity outdoors of 50% of the capacity of the stadium or 2,000 people, whichever is smaller. Indoors, the maximum capacity is 1,000. 
Indoor entertainment venues, such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys, must also close. 
The full government rules and guidance for tier 2 can be found_ here .  
Tier three 
Hospitality venues will have to close, except for delivery and takeaway service. In tier 3, hotels and other accommodation providers must also close, except for specific work purposes where people cannot return home. Outdoor sports, including golf and tennis, will be allowed to continue in all tiers, as will amateur team sports such as football. Unlike the first two tiers, spectators will not be allowed to watch sport in tier 3.

The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said an announcement could be made on Monday on moving the capital into tier 3. 
He told Sky News: “My understanding is that Covid-O is meeting as we speak – that’s the subcommittee of the cabinet that makes the recommendations. We will have to wait and see what the government decides – it’s a government decision, not my decision or London leaders’ decision.”

Dozens of MPs in London and nearby areas were warned about a surge in Covid cases – with some “off the chart” – on a virtual briefing with the health minister, Helen Whately, the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, and other officials on Monday. 
One London MP on the call told the Guardian they were alarmed to hear about the rate of transmission, adding: “The tone was markedly different today. The numbers have gone up so fast, even in the last two to three days. 
“Even in the last 24 hours, there were some boroughs in London where the bar was going off the chart. There was a lot of frustration on the call because it was only 45 minutes, there were a lot of MPs, a lot of questions remained unaddressed, unanswered. 
“The numbers were alarming, not just in London … in neighbouring areas as well: Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire, Kent.” 
Harries told MPs that numbers were akin to the start of the pandemic with a doubling rate of five to seven days. 
Khan has issued a number of appeals to Londoners to try to help contain cases in the capital, and has also urged the government to consider closing schools. 
In a letter to the prime minister on Monday, he said: “Urgent consideration must … be given to closing secondary schools, sixth form and FE colleges a few days early and keeping them closed for longer after Christmas.” 
Khan said face coverings should be made mandatory in all outside spaces that were busy with Christmas shoppers, especially in central London.

The Labour MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, Tulip Siddiq, said: “The government has to follow the science and keep the virus under control in London, but the impact of further restrictions without better support could be devastating. 
“Local hospitality businesses and others affected by reduced footfall are already teetering on the brink of collapse, and prolonged tier 3 restrictions could tip them over the edge if we aren’t careful. As well as better support for businesses and workers affected, we also need a clear exit strategy from restrictions, which will require the effective rollout of mass testing across the city at pace.” 

A man accused of brutally murdering a 16-year-old girl has told a court that he punched her repeatedly in the face but had not intended to kill her.  Shane Mays claimed he had struck Louise Smith after she hit him with a stick but told a jury he had not sexually assaulted her and had not defiled or tried to burn her body.    Mays, 30, of Havant, Hampshire, has admitted manslaughter but denies murdering Louise, whose body was found in woodland 13 days after vanishing on 8 May this year. The jury at Winchester crown court heard that Louise, who wanted to be a veterinary nurse, had suffered multiple blows to her head, causing her facial bone structure to collapse.  Mays told the court that Louise had started living with him and his wife, Chazlynn Jayne Mays – the girl’s aunt – at the end of April. He said she had been happy at first, but arguments started between them over chores at the flat and about her smoking cannabis.  After being shown a Snapchat video of him tickling Louise’s feet, he said he had not been flirting with her and said it was a “playful” act that he would do with “all the kids that came to stay”.  He said Louise wanted to refer to his wife and him as “mum and dad” and he sometimes regarded himself as like a father to her as she had lived with them previously.  The defendant said that on 8 May Louise asked him to walk with her to pick up some clothes from a friend. He said she had led him to woodland at Havant Thicket, where she had attacked him with a stick after she had talked about smoking cannabis.  Mays said: “She was getting all aggressive about it and started shouting, raising her voice. She picked up this big stick and started hitting me on the side with it.  “I grabbed the branch off her, threw it on the floor, then I punched her. The first punch she was standing, the second punch she went down.” When asked if there had been blood on her face, he replied: “I heard cracks, but I am not sure.”  He said he continued punching her on the ground and added: “I was angry and I lost control of myself.”  Mays told the court that he had left school at the age of 15 and had previously worked as a mechanic, in factories and laying asphalt, but had not worked since he was 24.  He said he played video games such as Call of Duty, Need for Speed and Fortnite for nine hours a day and had used cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy.  The trial continues.   

It was supposed to be a tour to thank the country amid the biggest crisis for a generation. But the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s 1,250-mile whistle-stop UK tour has met with a lukewarm reception from Wales and  Scotland  – while No 10 was briefly thrown into turmoil, declining to back the trip before declaring it “hugely valuable”. 
William and Kate may have hoped to spread festive cheer during the three-day nationwide tour aboard the royal train, during which they thanked key workers in England, Scotland and  Wales . 
But, while not directly criticising the couple’s decision to travel north, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, appeared to hint that their visit to  Edinburgh  went ahead despite Kensington Palace being made aware of restrictions on crossing the border. 
Meanwhile, the Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said he would rather no one was having “unnecessary visits” as Wales battles rising cases of Covid-19 infections. 
Royal sources have stressed the royal visits were planned in consultation with the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments. As the royal couple’s tour is categorised as a working visit, it would be exempt from the tier and travel restrictions. 
Questioned about the tour, a No 10 spokesman initially said it was “a matter for the Palace”, adding: “But we have set out clearly the tiers, and the advice around the current guidelines that we’re asking the public to abide by.” Asked if Downing Street was refusing to back the duke and duchess’s visits as a work trip, the spokesman repeated it was a matter solely for the Palace. 
But in statement issued shortly afterwards, Downing Street offered clear endorsement. The spokesman said: “The PM is delighted to see the warm reception the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have received on their hugely valuable train tour of England, Scotland and Wales. The tour will be a welcome morale boost to frontline workers who have done so much during the pandemic.” 
The couple visited Scotland and toured Berwick-upon-Tweed, Batley and  Manchester  on Monday as they met schoolchildren, ambulance workers, volunteers and charity workers. The tour ended at Windsor Castle, where the Queen joined them in thanking local volunteers and key workers. It was the first time the monarch has been seen in public with the Prince of Wales and senior members of the royal family since before the coronavirus pandemic. 
Asked about the visit on Monday, Sturgeon said: “The Scottish government was advised about the intention to visit, and we made sure that the royal household were aware, as you would expect, of the restrictions in place in Scotland so that could inform both the decision and the planning of the visit. Any more questions on that should be directed to the royal household.” 
The Scottish government later said Sturgeon had simply reiterated the guidance in place. A spokesman said the first minister welcomed the support shown by the duke and duchess for Scotland’s NHS. 
Ahead of the couple’s visit to Cardiff on Tuesday, Gething told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “I’d rather that no one was having unnecessary visits and people always have divisive views about the monarchy, but their visit isn’t an excuse for people to say that they are confused about what they are being asked to do.”

Asked whether William and Kate should still go, he said: “I’m not particularly bothered or interested because I don’t think that is going to be an excuse for people to say: ‘I should go and behave in a different way and I should act as if the harm that is being seen in front of us in every part of our healthcare system is not taking place’.” 
As well as meeting frontline workers, the couple are showcasing the UK’s arts, heritage and live performance sector, which has been supported throughout the pandemic by the government’s £1.57bn culture recovery fund.

The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, welcomed William and Kate’s trip to Cardiff, saying: “It is wonderful news that their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have been able to visit Cardiff today to see the impact that culture has on our communities.” 
The secretary for Wales, Simon Hart, also backed the trip, saying: “Wales’s cultural sector is one of our greatest assets, so it was great to see their Royal Highnesses in Cardiff experiencing some of the rich talent we continue to produce.” 
At Cardiff Castle, William and Kate met university students to hear about the mental health challenges they faced during the pandemic, and said they were struggling over their Christmas plans. William said: “It is so difficult. We are still trying to make plans. It’s difficult to know what to do for the best.” 

From the world-famous  Koh-i-noor  diamond to the  Rosetta Stone , British royals have long been gifted rare objects that campaigners want repatriated to their rightful lands.  Prince George, it seemed on Monday, was the latest to face such a request after being given a giant prehistoric shark tooth by the environmentalist and national treasure Sir  David Attenborough , who had found it on a family holiday to Malta more than 50 years ago.    Images of the delighted seven-year-old  examining his treasure  were released by Kensington Palace at the weekend, after Attenborough visited the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for a private viewing of his new environmental documentary A Life on Our Planet.  But the kindly gesture caused consternation in  Malta , a British colony until 1964 of which the Queen was head of state until 1974, and a country very close to her heart since she spent her first years of marriage to Prince Philip based there as a naval officer’s wife.  The Maltese culture minister, José Herrera, reportedly pledged to investigate if the tooth should, in fact, be returned for display on the island where it was originally excavated. 
Researchers reveal true scale of megalodon shark for first time  
Read more        The fossilised tooth, found embedded in soft yellow limestone, is believed to be about 23m years old and to have belonged to a Carcharocles megalodon, an extinct species of giant shark that could grow up to 16 metres (52 feet) long.  Megalodon teeth are said to be relatively common fossils in many locations, according to FossilEra.com, as megalodons and other sharks shed their teeth during their lifetime or as they grew. According to the website, an adult shark could shed thousands of teeth.

Photograph: Kensington Palace/AFP/Getty Images   Asked by the  Times of Malta  whether there were plans to add the tooth to the nation’s heritage collection, Herrera said he would “get the ball rolling”.  “There are some artefacts that are important to Maltese natural heritage, which ended up abroad and deserve to be retrieved,” he said.  “We rightly give a lot of attention to historical and artistic artefacts. However, it is not always the case with our natural history. I am determined to direct a change,” the paper quoted him saying.  Fossils fall under the definition of cultural heritage as a “movable or immovable object of geological importance” and, in line with the provisions of the Cultural  Heritage  Act 2002, their removal or excavation is now expressly forbidden, the Times of Malta reported.  Late on Monday, however, Malta’s culture ministry appeared to row back from the threat to Prince George’s keepsake. A spokesperson said: “The minister’s initial comments were based on the related national legislation in particular the Cultural Heritage Act, 2002 which superseded the previous legislation being the Antiquities (Protection) Act of 1910 and the Antiquities (Protection) Act of 1925. The minister would like to note that with reference to this case, it is not the intention to pursue this matter any further.”   Kensington Palace declined to comment on the issue.  The British royal family has long faced calls for the repatriation of a number of famous items, many the product of looting and plunder by explorers or soldiers over centuries or acquired through colonisation.  These include the famous diamond, the Koh-i-noor (Mountain of Light), reportedly worth more than £100m, and the star piece in the crown worn by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on the coronation of George VI, and again at the Queen’s 1953 coronation. It currently forms part of the crown jewels.  The 105-carat diamond, possibly mined in Kollur Mine, India, was part of the Mughal Peacock Throne and changed hands several times between various factions in south and west Asia until being ceded to Queen Victoria after the British annexation of the Punjab in 1849.  The governments of India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan have all claimed rightful ownership. There have been demands for its return since India gained independence from the UK in 1947, rejected by the British government, which has insisted it was obtained legally under the terms of the Treaty of Lahore. In recent years a group of Bollywood stars and business owners instructed lawyers to bring proceedings for its return.  A statue of the head of a king, presented to the present Queen by the former president of Nigeria, Gen Yakubu Gowon, was later revealed as a genuine Benin bronze dating back to 1600 after it went on display in 2002 as part of the Royal Collection Trust.  There have been sustained calls for the return of the  Benin Bronzes , a group of sculptures and plaques, many now in the British Museum, that once decorated the royal palace in the kingdom of Benin, now part of Nigeria.  The Rosetta Stone – the rock stele that allowed researchers to read hieroglyphs – is believed to have been found by solders in the Nile delta, with the British taking possession of it on Napoleon’s defeat in 1801.  George III offered it to the British Museum a few months after it arrived in Portsmouth in 1802. Egyptian officials have demanded its return for decades. A similar argument has played out over the Parthenon marbles, a series of Greek sculptures bought to the UK at around the same time and also housed in the British Museum.   

A 29-year-old man has been charged with the murder of 16-year-old Louise Smith, who disappeared on VE Day. Hampshire police said Shane Lee Mays, of Havant, has been remanded in custody and will appear at Portsmouth magistrates court on Friday. 
The teenager was last seen alive in the Leigh Park area of Havant at midday on 8 May. Her body was found in nearby woodland at Havant Thicket on 21 May. She was described by a family friend as a “lovely girl with a heart of gold”.

A 29-year-old woman, who was arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender in connection with the investigation, has been released on bail, police said. 

A man who was shot dead by police after firing an air pistol at an officer was lawfully killed, a jury has found.  Spencer Ashworth, 29, was fatally wounded by Avon and Somerset police officers on the Portbury Hundred stretch of the A369 near  Bristol  on 27 September 2017.    He had been driving south on the M5 when police received reports of a man firing what appeared to be a gun out of his car window.  Firearms officers stopped Ashworth, who was driving alone in his red Suzuki Swift, and surrounded his car with police vehicles at 9.32am.  The delivery driver did not comply with their instructions, instead raising his right hand and firing an air pistol at one of the officers.  Four of the five officers returned fire, discharging 15 rounds at Ashworth, who was pronounced dead at the scene at 9.54am.  A postmortem examination found Ashworth, originally from Southampton, died from gunshot wounds to the head and chest.  On Tuesday, a jury at Avon coroner’s court reached a conclusion that Ashworth had been lawfully killed by police.  Maria Voisin, the senior coroner for Avon, offered her condolences to Ashworth’s family.  “Thank you for attending, especially at the moment when we are all facing a rather large issue in the country and indeed the world,” Voisin told the jury.  During the inquest, jurors were played recordings of 999 calls made to police forces as Ashworth travelled down the M5, as well as bodycam footage from officers.  Ashworth’s mother, Yvonne Maunder, said he was a keen skateboarder who was talented at drawing but became “insular” in his late teens and would play computer games alone in his bedroom.  He moved out of the family home aged 22 to live in Plymouth, Bristol and then Portishead, and kept in touch with his mother through email and occasional phone calls.  In one email sent in August 2017, he referred to “my new James Bond air pistol” and described how he wanted to go to California “before I have to shoot it out with the police”.  The inquest heard that Ashworth, who was facing two prosecutions, had warning markers for violence, mental health and suicide on his police national computer record.   

Talks between ministers and  Greater Manchester  to put the region into the top level of coronavirus rules appeared deadlocked on Monday, as Downing Street prepared to move other parts of northern England under the tightest restrictions. 
While  Robert Jenrick , the communities secretary, said the “contours of an agreement” were in place, this was disputed by the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham. 
No announcement was expected imminently. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, was due to make a Commons statement on Covid later on Monday, but this was expected to focus on arrangements in Lancashire, which along with Liverpool was placed in the top tier last week. 
Downing Street said it was simultaneously in talks with local leaders in the north-east of England, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire about moving into tier 3 Covid restrictions, which include the closure of pubs, bars and other businesses. 
Four days after ministers first announced that Greater  Manchester  should be moved into tier 3, the talks remain deadlocked, with Burnham and other regional mayors still holding out for extra financial support for affected businesses and workers. 
“The discussions are ongoing,” Boris Johnson’s spokesman said, giving no further details. Reiterating that No 10 still wanted agreement, the spokesman said that if this was not possible the government would need to intervene “in order to protect hospitals and save the lives of residents”. 
To emphasise the government’s argument, Johnson’s spokesman released government data saying Covid infection rates in Greater Manchester had tripled in 15 days, and projections saying that without new action, all local intensive care beds would be full by 8 November. 
Infection rates compared chart 
The Treasury is offering Greater Manchester a financial package worth tens of millions of pounds, in line with those agreed with leaders in Lancashire and Merseyside. 
Johnson’s spokesman played down reports that Greater Manchester could be offered significantly more government support than Liverpool and Lancashire, saying he was “not familiar” with the figures quoted. 
Taking a notably conciliatory tone, Jenrick told Sky News he was “hopeful” of an agreement soon. He said: “We are going to be having further discussions today with the council leaders from across Greater Manchester and I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement. The contours of an agreement are there. But, as I say, every side needs to now come together and reach an amicable conclusion for the sake of people in Greater Manchester.” 
Also speaking to Sky, Burnham said he was still seeking a government package that would give people who lose their incomes because of the new rules 80% of their usual wages, rather than the two-thirds on offer. 
He said: “It’s not about the size of the cheque, it’s about protecting low-paid workers, people who are self-employed, and supporting businesses, protecting them from collapsing. 
“That isn’t there at the moment. If the government recognises that, and comes forward with a plan that protects those low-paid workers, protects people who are self-employed, protects freelancers, then of course, that is what this has all been about. But they haven’t presented that yet.” 
On Sunday, Burnham wrote to Johnson, Keir Starmer and other Westminster leaders  urging them to hold a parliamentary vote  to decide a national level of financial aid for all areas under tier 3 restrictions. 

People in low-paid, manual jobs face a much greater risk of dying from coronavirus than higher-paid, white-collar workers, according to official figures. 
Men in low-skilled jobs are four times more likely to die from the virus than men in professional occupations, while women working as carers are twice as likely to die as those in professional and technical roles. 
The findings have prompted calls for clear guidance for employers and employees as the government called for people who could not work from home to  return to work . 
Men 
Men in low-skilled jobs are almost four times more likely to die from coronavirus than professionals, with 21.4 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 5.6 among white-collar male workers. 
Security guards, care workers, construction workers, plant operatives, cleaners, taxi drivers, bus drivers, chefs and retail workers are all at a greater risk of dying, according to the  analysis of Covid-19 fatalities  in England and Wales up to 20 April from the Office for National Statistics. 
John Phillips, the acting general secretary of the GMB trade union, said the figures were “horrifying”. “If you are low-paid and working through the Covid-19 crisis, you are more likely to die – that’s how stark these figures are. Ministers must pause any return to work until proper guidelines, advice and enforcement are in place to keep people safe,” he said. 
Among people of working age, men (9.9 deaths per 100,000) are at a greater risk of dying from the virus than women (4.2 per 100,000). The figures show men working in the lowest-skilled jobs face the greatest risk of dying from the virus when compared to the wider working population. 
Men working as security guards had one of the highest death rates, at 45.7 fatalities for every 100,000, followed by taxi drivers and chauffeurs (36.4), bus and coach drivers (26.4), chefs (35.9), and sales and retail assistants (19.8). 
Men working as process, plant and machine operatives had a rate of 37.7 and low-skilled construction workers – who have been permitted to work throughout the lockdown – a rate of 25.9. 
Neil Pearce, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene _ Tropical Medicine, said: “In the working-age population, Covid-19 is largely an occupational disease. This is not just for healthcare and social care workers, but for many other occupations that involve contact with people ... These are many of the same occupations that are now being urged to return to work, in some instances without proper safety measures and PPE being in place.” 
Care workers and home carers  had higher death rates than the general population, with 23.4 deaths for every 100,000 men and 9.6 deaths for every 100,000 women. Healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have a higher death rate than the wider population. 
The figures indicate death rates are significantly higher in occupations where physical distancing is difficult, including construction, manufacturing and primary education. 
Dr Michael Head, a senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, said: “We already know that risk factors for dying from Covid-19 include, for example, being male, having underlying conditions, and ethnicity. The ONS data suggests certain occupations may be more at risk than others. So, taking the points above, a ‘male diabetic Asian bus driver’ is at higher risk than a ‘female healthy Caucasian company director’ of similar age. 
“There is much still to disentangle around Covid-19 risk factors and how best to use that information to manage aspects such as population return to work. However, right now the forthcoming guidance for safe working simply has to provide extensive detail on how each sector is expected to manage their staff and working environments. Employers and employees need that reassurance.” 
Women 
The Guardian has  previously reported  that black and ethic minority (BAME) people in England and Wales are  dying at a higher rate than white people . BAME workers are  over-represented in high-risk occupations , including transport, health and social care sectors. Covid-19  death rates are also higher  in the most deprived parts of England and Wales. 
Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies said the ONS figures highlighted the plight of BAME workers,  who were more likely to work in frontline services than white workers . 

The  Metropolitan police  commissioner has promised to break up events in London that flout coronavirus regulations after disorder on three consecutive nights when officers attempted to disperse illegal gatherings.  Police stood off with people who refused to leave an unlicensed music event in Kilburn, north London, on Friday, and officers had bottles thrown at them. Officers were pelted with objects in Brixton on Wednesday evening and in Notting Hill on Thursday.    Cressida Dick said police were on the lookout for illegal parties, which have been taking place as the lockdown begins to ease, as new coronavirus cases in London continue to plateau, amid fears of a second spike in cases. 
Met police twice as likely to fine black people over lockdown breaches – research  
Read more        The Met commissioner wrote in the Sun: “We have seen some large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families’ health and wanting to have large parties … big street parties are illegal and reckless.  “It is hot. Some people have drunk far too much. Some people are just angry and aggressive and some people are plain violent. We will be prepared this weekend. We have officers all over  London  working hard again to try to keep the peace and to protect our public from violence and disorder.”  The Met police commander Bas Javid said on Saturday policing efforts were focused on building relationships with local communities. He said the majority of interactions with police at events had been positive.  “We’re not going to arrest our way out of the situations like this, but what I can be clear about is if these situations do descend into chaos and violence and disorder, which is completely unacceptable, we will take a much more thorough and a robust position,” he told BBC Breakfast.  “It’s the communities that are very, very upset by this, as much as the police are. This is much more about the impact it’s having on those communities that these people live in.”  Meanwhile, the former Met commissioner Ian Blair said there needed to be a “public conversation” about violence directed towards police in recent weeks after about 140 officers were said to have been injured.  Elsewhere, officers in Newham, east London, dispersed a crowd on Friday afternoon after a sound system was set up. A man was arrested for possession of a firearm, police said. There were no known arrests in Kilburn.   While other parts of the country have a higher reinfection rate, in London there were 114 new cases of coronavirus confirmed from 13 June to 19 June, the most recent period for which data is available,  official figures showed .  After months of lockdown, the number of illegal parties appears to be rising – with licensed premises remaining closed. Tens of thousands of people flocked to beaches on the south coast on Friday,  leading Bournemouth council to declare a major incident .  The government has been warned that draconian responses to unrest and lockdown violations  risk inflaming disorder as restrictions on movement continue to lift .  Tim Newburn, professor of criminology and social policy at the London School of Economics, said on Friday that talking about crackdowns and firm policing was “really fantastically unhelpful,” after Priti Patel ordered a crackdown on protests.  He said: “It tells young people that there’s likely to be conflict so be ready for it, but it also restricts the freedom of the police to act.  “What is needed at the moment is clear and firm messaging about the rules around the pandemic, but allowing police to exercise their judgment in difficult circumstances. That’s been lost.”  This week, Boris Johnson urged people to get out and “enjoy themselves” from next weekend, claiming that “ the bustle is starting to come back ”.  But the prime minister later criticised beachgoers for “taking too many liberties” as people appeared unable to physically distance because of sheer numbers, while others left excessive waste and there were pockets of violence.  In Liverpool, police have been granted more power to disperse crowds after part of the  Liver Building caught fire  during celebrations after the team’s Premier League triumph. The force has urged fans to put safety first and save their celebrations for when they may be permitted in the future.   

I am becoming increasingly annoyed at families seeking a day out at the seaside being described as “selfish” ( ‘The atmosphere was ugly’: Bournemouth aghast at beach chaos , 26 June).  Many of these families have put up with months of educating and entertaining their children in challenging circumstances. There has been very little attention given to the needs of children. Most have been unable to return to school. They have not been allowed to socialise with friends and there is no provision for them. Playgrounds are closed, along with skate parks, soft play areas and swimming pools.    Many families do not have any outdoor space – no wonder they leapt at the chance to take the children to the seaside. They weren’t to know that hundreds of thousands of people would also arrive at the beaches, and after a long hot journey with children anticipating a day at the seaside it’s not surprising that they refused to turn back.   Many of the people complaining of selfishness have had beautiful coastal areas to enjoy for the whole of lockdown; it would be more reasonable if they were encouraged to sit in their own gardens on busy days and let the children have some fun – after all they do not own the coast. This will be a temporary problem as once more facilities open families will have more alternatives for entertaining their children.  Sue Morgan   Winchester   • I am stunned that  Matt Hancock  could say “people have had a pretty tough lockdown” and therefore the government would be reluctant to shut down public spaces. As a Bournemouth resident, my family abided by the lockdown rules and yet we now find ourselves unable to go anywhere near the beach on hot days. If a gathering of 500,000 people doesn’t break the rules, what does?  And it’s not only residents who are at risk, it is the visitors themselves, alongside refuse workers, traffic wardens, ambulance crews and police. If anyone from Sage had been here to witness the scenes, I’m sure they would have been horrified. It was left to the council and MP Tobias Ellwood to tell Boris Johnson that encouraging people to get out and enjoy themselves could result in a major incident. What will it take for this government to come up with a proper approach to easing lockdown that protects everyone?  Gill Coleman   Bournemouth    

Northern Ireland  is facing disruptions to its food supply because suppliers in Great Britain are unaware of the Brexit-related paperwork needed to send goods to the region, business leaders have said.  Trucks are arriving at GB ports with incorrect or absent documentation that delays their passage across the Irish Sea, they told MPs on Wednesday.    Many operators in Great Britain seemed unaware that since 11pm on New Year’s Eve  Northern Ireland  was applying EU customs rules at its ports, meaning goods crossing the Irish Sea from other parts of the UK were subject to customs checks, Seamus Leheny, of the freight trade body Logistics UK, told the  Northern Ireland  affairs committee. “We had lorries arriving into Belfast with no documentation at all … it’s the lack of preparation on the GB side.”  One large manufacturer had 15 lorries of food bound for Northern Ireland stuck because they lacked customs declarations, said Leheny. He cited another company that sent 285 lorries to Great Britain but only 100 returned, leading to knock-on disruption of supply chains. Another company resolved documentation problems after studying a YouTube tutorial.  Leheny said ports and customs officials were working hard and flexibly to minimise disruption but he urged the government to improve communication so that hauliers were not left figuring out paperwork on their own.  Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, told MPs that authorities in Belfast and London needed to be “shouting from the rooftops” so that suppliers and  parcel companies  understood the new rules. “This is a very turbulent time where decisions need to be taken at speed,” he said.  Sainsbury’s has been forced to fill some of its Northern Ireland supermarket shelves with Spar-branded products. Shoppers at Tesco and other chains have reported bare shelves in some sections, especially chilled food.  England, Scotland and Wales left the European Union’s single market for goods on 31 December but Northern Ireland did not. Products containing animal parts require export health certificates in accordance with EU regulations.  Ian Paisley, an MP with the Democratic Unionist party, said the special arrangements for the region had been a “disaster” and justified ditching the Northern Ireland protocol, which had cleared the way for the final  Brexit  deal between London and Brussels.  Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary,  told BBC Radio Ulster  that companies were adapting to changes. “I think people will see, as things settle down, that things will flow as they did in 2020.”   

An oil tanker that was stormed by special forces off the Isle of Wight after a suspected hijack attempt had been denied port access by  France  and Spain to disembark seven stowaways in the days leading up to the incident.  The men were detained  when the Special Boat Service (SBS) stormed the Liberian-registered tanker on Sunday  after it was feared the crew was no longer fully in charge.    But the Guardian understands French authorities had previously refused the Nave Andromeda permission to berth and disembark the stowaways while Spanish authorities denied the tanker access to Las Palmas port.    According to the shipping newspaper Lloyd’s List , vessel-tracking data shows the tanker sailed from Nigerian waters on 5 October and spent two days off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts before arriving in French waters.  It spent 24 hours off the French coast near Saint-Nazaire from 20 October, before sailing north and arriving in waters off the south coast of England on 25 October.  The International Maritime Organization guidelines on stowaways state that shipmasters are required to notify authorities of the existence of stowaways at the next port of call, as well as taking steps to establish their identity and where they embarked.  Shipmasters must also ensure the security, general health, welfare and safety of stowaways until disembarkation, as well as ensuring they are treated humanely.  The Nave Andromeda’s operator, Navios Tankers Management, said the stowaways “illegally boarded” the tanker in Lagos. It also thanked the UK authorities involved in the operation “for their timely and professional response”.  A statement from the company said the master of the ship had become “concerned for the safety of the crew due to the increasingly hostile behaviour of the stowaways” as they approached the UK.  Sources told Lloyd’s List that the master remained in control at the bridge and the chief engineer was locked in the engine room.  The 228-metre oil tanker had been due to dock in  Southampton  on Sunday to pick up a cargo of petrol but its course in the Channel became erratic, prompting calls for an intervention as it passed the south-east edge of the Isle of Wight.  The SBS used two  Royal Navy  Merlin and two Wildcat helicopters to take control of the tanker. Hampshire police said all 22 crew members were safe and well, and the vessel has been detained while officers carry out investigations.  The stowaways  have been arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force  under the UK’s Aviation and Maritime Security Act 1990.  • This article was amended on 31 October 2020 to clarify the route taken by the Nave Andromeda. An earlier version, which wrongly stated that the ship had sailed from French waters to the Spanish and Portuguese coasts, was based on incorrect information initially published by Lloyd’s List.   

The government has been severely criticised for a proposal to house up to 500 asylum seekers in “temporary buildings akin to an open prison” next to a small Hampshire village.  The plans to construct cabin-style accommodation on former Ministry of Defence land near Barton Stacey, close to the A303 trunk road, follow a series of damning reports on conditions at  two former army barracks sites  in Kent and Pembrokeshire being used to hold up to 600 asylum-seeking men.    Among the critics of the Hampshire proposal is the Conservative leader of Test Valley council, Phil North, who said Barton Stacey was one of a number of sites being considered by the government. The  Home Office  would not reveal the locations of other sites.  North said: “I completely understand the argument about disincentivising dangerous Channel crossings facilitated by criminal gangs of people smugglers, but whether you think this country should house more asylum seekers or not, putting these individuals up in temporary buildings akin to an open prison is the wrong accommodation in the wrong location.  “Apart from some dining and basic recreation facilities, there will be absolutely nothing for them to do. There are few places I would consider less appropriate for a facility of this nature and it concerns me that this would even be considered.  “With no substantial facilities in the vicinity, occupants of the camp will almost certainly want to access the A303 road services on foot. This represents a significant highway danger in them walking on land adjacent to the road and in the carriageway itself.”  He added: “An influx of 500 young men in a village with an existing population of just 1,000 would have an overwhelmingly detrimental impact.”  The council leader, along with the MP for Romsey and Southampton North, Caroline Nokes, a former immigration minister, have launched a petition against the proposal.  Napier barracks in Kent and Penally barracks in Pembrokeshire were handed over by the MoD to the  Home Office  in September to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers.  Since then, the Home Office has faced allegations of  poor access to healthcare , denial of  access to lawyers , overbearing use of  confidentiality agreements  and concerns  over safety and privacy at the sites .   Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said: “The way we currently treat people seeking asylum is becoming a stain on our national conscience. Herding vulnerable people behind barbed wire in a barracks or in a portable cabin in the middle of the countryside, when they desperately need access to health and legal support, is inhumane.  “The government must rediscover their compassion and common sense. People seeking asylum should be housed in our communities.”  A Home Office spokesperson said: “Given pressure on the system during these unprecedented times, we have worked tirelessly with local authorities and other partners to provide asylum seekers, who would otherwise be destitute, with suitable accommodation, as we are required to do by law.  “Following a review of available government property, the MoD offered temporary use of some of its sites. This includes Barton Stacey and we are engaging with leaders and officials at Test Valley and Hampshire councils, local MPs, the police and health services, among others, as we continue to explore this as an option.”   

Police are ready to set up roadblocks, create diversions and close off sections of  Bournemouth  beach to prevent a repeat of last month’s chaotic scenes as a heatwave sweeps parts of the UK.  With temperatures forecast to hit 33C in parts of southern England, some officers have been asked to work extended shifts and weekend leave has been cancelled for others as the emergency services and the local council brace themselves for another major influx of visitors.    The moves come as the prime minister, Boris Johnson, urged people not to lose focus and risk spreading Covid-19. He said on Thursday: “Broadly speaking, the only way to control coronavirus is if everybody collectively obeys the social distancing rules and works together to drive the virus down.  “What I’m saying to people is: don’t lose focus, don’t lose discipline, continue to observe those guidelines, and if you have symptoms, get a test.”   A major incident was declared during June’s hot spell  when as many as half a million people descended on the beaches at Bournemouth and Poole.  Supt Richard Bell, of Dorset police, said plans had been put in place to cope with another possible surge. But Bell said: “We are definitely not asking people to stay away. We welcome all visitors, but ask them to respect the environment and the community.”  He said the force did not expect the beaches to be as crowded this time because hotels, campsites, pubs and restaurants are open. In June, the beach was one of the few places people could go to.  A plan is also in place for Lulworth Cove in Dorset,  another spot that has attracted crowds this summer . Bell said a one-way system used when the Camp Bestival was being staged would swing into operation if it got too busy.  Specific operations are being run to make sure powerboat and jetski users do not put anyone in danger and to patrol spots where drinking has become popular during lockdown.  The local authority, BCP council, has brought in  new powers to tow vehicles away  if they have been left in dangerous spots and is also asking people to use a new app it has developed that pinpoints busy parts of the beaches.  Cornwall council also asked people to plan their visits carefully. Rob Nolan, cabinet member for environment and public protection, said: “Visitors should be aware it’s not the  Cornwall  they would expect.” He said many campsites, B_Bs, pubs and restaurants were running at 50% capacity. “Do your research, book ahead,” he said.  Meanwhile, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) and HM Coastguard urged every parent to be aware of the potential dangers of the water, especially rip currents.  On Sunday, eight teenagers were rescued after being caught in a strong, fast-moving current off the beach at Aberdovey in mid-Wales, while at the start of the month RNLI lifeguards rescued 12 bathers who were swept off their feet by a rip current into rough seas at a beach in Cornwall.  Gareth Morrison, RNLI head of water safety, said: “We are seeing a spike in incidents this summer involving these potentially deadly currents, which move even faster than an Olympic swimmer and can quickly drag people into deep water a long way from the shore.”  Labour’s shadow tourism minister, Alex Sobel, welcomed much needed returning business to tourist towns, but urged people to act sensibly. Referring to the packed beaches, Sobel said: “Particularly at that point, people had been locked down for so long, and [there was] the sense of relief and euphoria. We’re probably at a slightly different place now – the restrictions have been easing gradually over the last six weeks, so it might be better now.  “But people really do need to act sensibly. If we don’t observe social distancing, we are increasing the chance of us having a local epidemic, which would mean local lockdown [and] potential for people who are going to those beaches becoming ill.”   

Police forces across England will deploy additional patrols on Saturday as pubs reopen, part of the biggest easing of Covid-19 lockdown measures to date.  Pubs, restaurants, cafes, hotels and other hospitality and entertainment services will open on Saturday for the first time since mid-March, with strict conditions in place.    Some concerns have been raised about the timing of the reopening, the levels of alcohol consumption expected and potential knock-on effects on behaviour and social distancing.  John Apter, the national chair of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said drunken behaviour could increase pressure on policing. “I know that there is a lot of frustration out there and businesses need to start making money, but public safety must be paramount and pressure on public services must be considered,” he said.  The Labour police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, David   Jamieson, warned of “potential chaos” this weekend. He said: “I am in favour of the gradual lifting of the lockdown, based on the science, but not in the way the government have proceeded. It would have been sensible for the government to schedule the first day of pub openings for midweek, or the Monday afterwards rather than a Saturday.  “That would have allowed venues to take a more sensible approach. That is not just my view but is shared by many police and crime commissioners across the country who raised this issue with the policing minister recently.”  A number of forces told the Guardian they would send out additional patrols to deal with any trouble associated with the easing of the lockdown. Hertfordshire constabulary, Cleveland police and Lincolnshire police are among forces planning to put extra boots on the streets.  Ch Supt Richard Liversidge, Hertfordshire’s local policing commander, said: “While the vast majority of people will drink responsibly, some will drink to excess and become vulnerable to harm or indeed cause harm to others. I’d ask licensees and customers to remain vigilant and work together to maintain a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone.  “Antisocial and criminal behaviour is not acceptable and Hertfordshire constabulary is working to support the safe and crime-free reopening of pubs. Please, know your limits, plan your day and consider how you will get home safely.”  Ch Supt Ciaron Irvine, of Cleveland police, who cover Middlesbrough and Redcar, said: “Our joint operational responses will see additional officers and staff on duty, patrolling for reassurance purposes and to respond to any incidents effectively. The public has been outstanding in supporting the NHS and the last thing we want to see is our local emergency departments overwhelmed with alcohol-related injuries that will place additional pressure on a service that has worked tirelessly to keep us all safe in recent months.”  Some forces told the Guardian that owing to the restrictions still in place and the fact that many premises would not be reopening, including all nightclubs, they were not expecting significant numbers.  Northumbria police, who cover Newcastle and Sunderland, said they had tried-and-tested plans for policing the night-time economy, and the response would be proportionate. The force said it was expecting far fewer people in cities and towns than officers were used to dealing with prior to lockdown.  Lincolnshire police, who cover the towns of Lincoln and Grimsby, said they would have extra patrols on the roads at key times in response to the pubs reopening and would be seeking out anyone driving while unfit through alcohol or drugs.  Bedfordshire police plan to target patrols at pub and restaurant hotspots, focusing on the “engaging, explaining and encouraging” strategy used through the Covid-19 response.  Rachel Kearton, the National Police Chiefs’ Council (NPCC) lead for alcohol licensing and harm reduction, said: “We urge people to drink responsibly, follow the guidance set out and maintain a safe environment for everyone. The vast majority of drinkers are responsible but we know some people will drink to excess and become vulnerable to harm or indeed cause harm to others.  “The key advice is to know your limits, plan your day and consider how you will get home safely. Antisocial and criminal behaviour is not acceptable and police continue to work with the night-time economy to maximise safety and cut crime.”   

Police officers have prevented a wedding party going ahead as forces urge people to comply with coronavirus restrictions over the warm, sunny weekend.  Greater Manchester police said officers stopped restrictions being breached after responding to reports of a wedding party at a house in Wythenshawe on Friday evening.

Read more        “Police attended and found that a gazebo had been erected in the garden of a property,” the force tweeted. “Officers prevented the illegal gathering before restrictions were breached.”  The Met Office has forecast a weekend of “largely dry, bright and fine” weather, with temperatures reaching up to 24C.  In Kent, the county’s assistant chief constable Claire Nix said there would be an increased presence in “key areas” this weekend, as Covid-19 remained a “real and deadly threat”.  “Kent has had a very good compliance rate when it comes to adhering to the national health advice around the coronavirus,” Nix said.  “However, the government has made it clear that the risk of increasing infections is too great to ignore and stricter social gathering rules have now come into effect to help keep everyone safe.  “There will be an increased presence in key locations around the county to ensure the current national advice is adhered to, such as preventing unlicensed music events and illegal gatherings.  The Metropolitan police urged Londoners to “continue to act responsibly” over the weekend.  The force said it would continue to patrol public spaces and respond to incidents where groups of more than six were gathering, reminding the public that fines could be issued for breaching coronavirus guidelines.  Most  social gatherings of more than six people  in England are against the law, with people facing fines of up to £3,200 if they do not abide by the new measure, which applies to both indoor and outdoor settings.  Further  lockdown measures were introduced in northern parts of England  on Friday.  Liverpool is forecast to experience highs of 19C on Saturday and Sunday and stay bright and dry, as are parts of north-east England, such as Newcastle, although the temperature will be cooler, at around 15C.   

Police have said they will break up anti-lockdown protests advertised on social media for this weekend if necessary, amid warnings that the events could be exploited by the far right.  Flyers for around 60 protests to be held in parks in cities such as Manchester, Leicester and Southampton have circulated online, produced by the little-known “UK Freedom Movement” which aims to say “no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown”.    A spokesperson for Greater Manchester police said: “We have patrol plans in place throughout the area to respond to these protests if required.” Similar comments have been made by several other forces.  Rules on physical distancing mean no large-scale gatherings are permitted. People are allowed to meet just one other person from outside their household at a time, and must keep two metres apart.  It is not clear who is behind the flyers, which also say “no to mandatory vaccines”, and police are unsure how seriously to take them. But there are warnings that they tap into coronavirus arguments swirling on the far right.  Police sources told the Guardian there was a “cross-pollination” between anti-lockdown sentiment and the far right.  On Thursday Jayda Fransen, a former deputy leader of the extremist  anti-Muslim group Britain First , highlighted a month old YouTube channel called the British Freedom Movement on her Telegram feed. She is also the sole director of a company created at the end of last month called Freedom Movement Ltd.  Although she did not claim to be behind the weekend flyers, Fransen is one of a number of far-right figures who are trying to win support by opposing the lockdown.  One of the YouTube videos from Fransen’s organisation announces that she is launching a “free advocacy service” aimed at “my people” and anyone subjected to “tyrannical and unlawful policing” during the lockdown.  Unlike in the US, anti-lockdown protests have so far been minimal in the UK. Police broke up a protest by around 50 people in Westminster on Saturday carrying banners and messages ranging from “no consent” to 5G conspiracy theories.  Hope Not Hate, an anti-extremism campaign group, said that while it did not believe the latest planned protests were organised by the far right, it did say there was a big risk of cross-pollination, partly because of the narratives being promoted around the groups.  Patrik Hermansson, from Hope Not Hate, said: “We already see far-right narratives occasionally spread in these groups, antisemitic conspiracy theories etc. A rise in conspiracy theory will almost inevitably lead to rise in things like antisemitic conspiracy theory, and what we are seeing is very much in line with that.”  The former BNP leader Nick Griffin has been criticising “Covidcops” and encouraging people to “smash the lockdown” on his Twitter feed in the past couple of weeks, while Tommy Robinson filmed himself criticising police for setting up a mobile speed camera, claiming it unfairly targeted key workers.  Tackling far-right extremism represents a growing proportion of the work undertaken by counter-terrorism police and MI5. The security service was handed the lead responsibility to tackle the threat in 2018, and last year among six violent terror plots it disrupted, three were from the far right.  Experts and police have cautioned that people have had more time to engage with extremist material during the crisis. Jacob Davey, of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, said: “The concern is that while the whole population has been locked down it creates the opportunity for people to be radicalised by rightwing content.”  There is some anecdotal evidence that traffic to far-right sites has grown. The ISD said an international white supremacist Telegram channel focusing on coronavirus grew its user base from 300 to 2,700 people in a month.  Police are also concerned that fewer people are making referrals to the government’s anti-radicalisation Prevent programme during lockdown. Around a quarter of cases referred to Prevent related to the far right.  Ch Supt Nik Adams, the national coordinator for Prevent, said: “Isolation may exacerbate grievances that make people more vulnerable to radicalisation, such as financial insecurity or social alienation. The extremists and radicalisers know this and, as ever, will look to exploit any opportunity to lead those people into harm, often using topical issues as hooks to lure them in.”   

Arts   The prolific author  Susan Hill  and the renowned choreographer  Siobhan Davies  have both been made dames.    Hill, the author of The Woman in Black, has won numerous awards for her work, including the Whitbread novel award, and is one of few living authors to have three books on the set book lists for GCSEs and A-levels.  Davies rose to prominence as a founding member of the London Contemporary Dance Theatre and is the artistic director of Siobhan Davies Dance.

Gallagher, a multimillionaire property developer, has handed the Tories hundreds of thousands of pounds via his firm, Countywide Developments Ltd. Among a series of donations in recent years, the company gave £500,000 to the Conservative party prior to the general election last year. Gallagher is being honoured for “services to land development and the property business”.  The businessman, who hosted a 50th birthday party for Cameron at his 17th-century country mansion in 2016, is said to be part of the so-called “Chipping Norton set” based near the Cotswolds village in Cameron’s old Oxfordshire constituency.

More than 750,000 people signed up.  Ghorbangholi, of Ealing, west London, said: “I spent most of my time in a dark room staring at a computer screen, so the OBE really means a lot to me.” Of an increase in black and minority ethnic recipients of honours, he added: “It shows diversity and great work and great achievements honoured regardless of your background, age and sex, it can be a motivation factor for so many.”   Prof   Stephen Holgate , a co-founder of the pharmaceutical company Synairgen, which has developed an inhaled coronavirus treatment, receives a knighthood. Holgate, also a clinical professor of immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton, said: “After lacking the limelight for so long, it is wonderful that the dedication, imagination and courage of so many colleagues is now being recognised in positioning lung disease as a top medical priority.”

I couldn’t have done it without working really closely with colleagues across London.”    

Rental e-scooters will be legal on UK streets from Saturday, the government has announced, in a move to improve the availability of coronavirus-proof alternatives to public transport.  But privately owned scooters, widely sold and used across the UK, will remain illegal, the government has said, due to the difficulty of regulating the devices, and the requirement on the part of scooter hire firms to provide insurance for riders.    The move is a rapid acceleration of a plan,  first announced in March , that would have initially seen scooters allowed in only four “future transport zones”: Portsmouth and Southampton, the West of England Combined Authority (WECA), Derby and Nottingham, and the West Midlands.  The coronavirus crisis forced the government to speed up the pace of change. Local authorities will  now be able  to set up their own trials in coordination with private companies. The legislation comes with limitations: a cap on max speeds, and a recommendation, though not a requirement, to wear a helmet.   The transport minister, Rachel Maclean, said: “As we emerge from lockdown, we have a unique opportunity in transport to build back in a greener, more sustainable way that could lead to cleaner air and healthier communities across Great Britain.  “E-scooters may offer the potential for convenient, clean and cost-effective travel that may also help ease the burden on the transport network, provide another green alternative to get around, and allow for social distancing. The trials will allow us to test whether they do these things.”  One of the suppliers will be Bird, a Santa Monica-based rental firm. The company launched a trial service in London’s Olympic park in 2018, taking advantage of the fact that e-scooters were, and are, legal on private land with the landowner’s permission.  “When we launched the UK’s first and only scooter service in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2018, it was with the ambition of one day being able to trial our service in towns and cities,” said Patrick Studener, head of Bird. “This day has arrived, and shortly the whole of the UK will be able to benefit from having a greener and more convenient alternative to cars. Decreasing car trips will reduce congestion and air pollution and make our towns and cities more livable for everyone.”  But the scooters have proved controversial. Campaigners claim they  pose a risk to riders and pedestrians , particularly since, unlike bicycles, they tend to be ridden more fluidly between pavement and road. Ben Pepper, associate at the law firm Bolt Burdon Kemp, said: “There are features of e-scooters that arguably make them more dangerous to ride than bicycles. They have smaller wheels and they are capable of reaching high speeds with no human effort whatsoever.”  The rental model, in which e-scooters are left on city streets where they can be unlocked with an app and paid for by the minute, has also been criticised. Without dedicated docks to keep them in, the scooters are often left on the pavement, blocking footpaths for pedestrians, and making it difficult to manoeuvre wheelchairs or prams around them.  Scooter companies argue the antisocial behaviour of some users can be mitigated – some apps, for instance, require users to post a picture of where they have left their scooter – and say that the transformative possibilities for public transport should not be underestimated.    

N   o one knows for sure when Richard “Richie” Mawson contracted coronavirus, but, if his family were to guess, they would say it was related to  the Champions League game between Liverpool and Atlético Madrid  at Anfield on 11 March.   Richie, 70, a retired train driver from Kirkdale,  Liverpool , was in the Sir Kenny Dalglish stand that day, as he was for every  Liverpool  game. A season ticket holder, Richie had been attending  Liverpool  matches since he was a teenager. His uncle would take him to watch the Reds, back when Everton were the more successful club, and the Blues fans would give them stick.    He had been at Hillsborough in Sheffield on 15 April 1989, too,  when 96 people died as a result of a crush inside the stadium  before Liverpool were due to play Nottingham Forest in an FA Cup semi-final. Richie and his son, Jamie, now 48, were in the stand directly above the crush. They saw everything. At home, Richie’s wife, Mary, watched, appalled, as the disaster unfolded on TV. She saw ashen-faced men and boys clawing their way over the fence and collapsing on the pitch. Then she saw Jamie and Richie, hauling people up to the safety of their stand, and she knew that they were safe.  When the police came round to interview them afterwards, Jamie says he had never seen his father so angry.  ***  Richie set out from the flat he shared in Kirkdale with Mary, 72, just after 6.30pm on the day of the Atlético match. It was a little earlier than usual, because a friend had given him a spare ticket for the hospitality lounge and he planned to eat before the game – the club usually laid on a carvery.  Richie and Mary would have celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary on 1 August. They met on the No 3 bus. Richie was a bus conductor; Mary worked at the British American Tobacco cigarette factory. “Every time I got on the bus, he would ask me out,” Mary remembers. “I would say: ‘Go away now!’’’ Market stallholders would ride the bus with crates of flowers and Richie would persuade them to give him daffodils or tulips to present to Mary. She relented; they got married in their early 20s. “In them days, that was kind of old,” Mary says.         On holiday, Richie would rise early and bolt for the sun loungers       It was a happy marriage. “I liked everything about him,” she says. “He was just a good person.” Richie became a train driver for Merseyrail and Mary a care worker. Working on the trains, he saw suicides. He once had to climb on to the tracks to turn off the power after a young girl jumped. “He never took time off,” Mary says. “Maggie Thatcher had ruined all the jobs. You were lucky to have one in those days.”  Richie loved family, holidays, Liverpool FC and horse racing – in more or less that order. Most of the time, the family went to Spain. “Every year, he’d be on the phone, harassing me to book the holiday for that year,” says Jamie. “‘Come on!’ he’d say. ‘Have you booked it yet? We’re going to miss out!” When away, in time-honoured tourist fashion, Richie would rise early and bolt for the sun loungers. “He was terrible,” says Jamie. “It was the most embarrassing thing ever. He’d wait there with his towel. My daughter filmed him once, at six in the morning, running to get the sunbeds with all the other tourists. He was out in front.”  If Richie had a weakness, it was his love of betting, although he never spent more than he could afford, putting down only 50p or £1 on a bet. “Nothing went short in this house,” Mary says. “You couldn’t argue about it.” He could also be grumpy. “Me dad was a terrible moaner,” says Jamie, laughing. Richie moaned the most when his horses were losing. “I’ll be honest with you, he was absolutely useless,” says his friend John Gallagher, 69, a business owner. “He couldn’t pick a horse. He was the worst gambler I ever met.”  Richie was cheerful, popular, well turned out. He shined his shoes, even if he was only taking the dog for a walk. He always did the washing-up. He went to the gym twice a week. He was never cruel, although he often made fun of Mary, especially when she was taking too long at the shops and he wanted to go home. He was a good husband. “Richie was sound as a pound,” says John. “He loved life.”  ***  As Richie walked the half an hour or so to Anfield,  3,000 Atlético fans were gulping down the dregs of their pints  in the narrow pubs of Mathew Street in the city centre, before assembling five minutes away in Williamson Square. This is the tradition for all the major European games: the away fans assemble in central Liverpool and march together to the stadium, 45 minutes north-east.   It was a blustery evening and the away fans had to shout to be heard over the wind, which clawed at their Atlético scarves. Richie walked through the singing fans as they marched, arm in arm. Most of the Atlético supporters peeled off towards the Anfield Road end of the stadium; Richie made for the Sir Kenny Dalglish stand, named after the Liverpool legend who would later  test positive for coronavirus himself . Richie climbed up the stairs towards the hospitality lounge, as the rest of the 52,000 fans piled in.  As Richie ate his carvery, Maria Eagle, the MP for Garston and Halewood, which includes parts of south-east Liverpool, was on the floor of the House of Commons. Addressing Matt Hancock, the health secretary,  Eagle said : “Can I press the right honourable gentleman on the issue of the 3,000 or so Atlético Madrid fans who have travelled to Liverpool and are, at the moment, in a crowd of 54,000 at Anfield [the official attendance was later reported as 52,267]? Schools and colleges are closed in Madrid and public gatherings of over 1,000 people are banned.”  
‘There was no leadership or public prevention measures being taken by the government’ ... Atlético fans at Anfield on 11 March.  Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA   It had been an exhausting day for Hancock. He had attended a cabinet meeting, then a meeting of the emergency committee Cobra, which he chaired, and finally he had addressed the house on the coronavirus. It was past 7pm when Eagle asked her question.  Earlier that day, the World Health Organization had  declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic . Nadine Dorries, a health minister, had  tested positive for the virus the day before . Dr David Halpern, a member of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), had  used the phrase “herd immunity”  in public for the first time. That morning, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak,  had announced a £30bn fiscal stimulus package  in his first budget to mitigate the damage caused by Covid-19. Within weeks, £30bn would look like small change, with Sunak making available  £330bn in government support  and pledging to do “whatever it takes” to keep Britain solvent.  “Is it really sensible for fans who could not watch their team at home to be able to travel to Liverpool and watch their team play with 51,000 locals?” Eagle finished by asking. Hancock stepped up to the dispatch box. “We will always follow the scientific advice on what makes the biggest impact,” he said. “It is interesting, listening to the scientists, that sometimes the things that we, as lay people, may feel intuitively will have the biggest impact do not, in fact, have the biggest impact … There are some things that feel right, but do not have an impact at all.”  The government insisted that it was  “following the science” . Mass events in England would not be shut down, because the scientists and Public Health England did not deem it necessary. When ministers said “the science”, what they meant was Sage, but what they really meant was the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a Sage sub-group that had been data-modelling the pandemic and which counted among its members Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London.  Five days after the game at Anfield,  Ferguson would perform a handbrake turn  after new data revealed that Britain was en route to  as many as half a million deaths . But as Richie stood in the stand, the SPI-M modellers were still saying that mass events could go ahead. The reasoning was that  the risk of Covid-19 transmission in the open air was low . Sage’s behavioural science sub-group, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza group on Behaviours, also made the point that holding a major football game behind closed doors would just mean that  fans congregated in confined spaces such as pubs or friends’ houses .  Not everyone agreed with what the government called “the science”, however. On the morning of the match, Prof John Ashton landed at Heathrow from Bahrain, where he had been advising the Bahraini government on its Covid-19 response. Ashton, a Liverpudlian, is semiretired: a former director of public health for the north-west, he has also held positions at the University of Liverpool and the University of Southampton.  Most people know Ashton in Liverpool for Hillsborough. He was there that day in 1989, only a few feet away from Richie and Jamie. A doctor by training, Ashton established an emergency triage on the pitch. “I was a spectator who finished up the afternoon certifying people dead at a football match,” he says.  When he arrived in London from Bahrain, Ashton picked up the newspapers and was aghast to learn that the UK government was refusing to ban mass events. Ashton is a Liverpool season ticket holder, but he did not go to the game that night. He wanted to set an example.  
‘There will have been concentric circles of infection outwards, like throwing stones on a pond’ ... Prof John Ashton on the effect of the game.  Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian   On the day of the match, Madrid had become the centre of the pandemic, with  782 of the confirmed 1,646 Covid-19 cases  in Spain located in the city. Spain had already endured 35 deaths. The number of cases outside China  had increased 13-fold  in the previous two weeks and the WHO had warned that things would get much worse. “We are deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction,” said the WHO’s director-general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.  On the same night that Liverpool played Atlético,  Paris Saint-Germain hosted Borussia Dortmund behind closed doors , at the request of the French authorities. The week after the Liverpool game, Ashton said the British government’s decision to allow the game at Anfield to go ahead was the result of  “clinical and policy negligence” .  “These modellers from London must have a very strange idea about what the social experience of going to a big football match is,” Ashton says now. “They must think you just go to a football match and then you go home.” In reality, “visiting supporters would be in Liverpool for at least 24 hours. They’d be out and about, drinking, mixing with local people, in the hotel, at the ground. They’d go to the souvenir shop at Anfield. The contact time is not just two hours of people sitting in rows behind each other. It’s much more than that.”  An analysis of NHS data by the consultancy Edge Health suggests that the Liverpool-Atlético game  may have led to an extra 41 Covid-19 deaths in Liverpool  – nearly half the death toll at Hillsborough. On the day of the match, Liverpool had  six confirmed Covid-19 cases . By 2 April, this figure had  risen to 262 . By 3 May,  303 people had died of Covid-19 in Liverpool  – one of the highest death tolls in the UK outside of London. By 15 May, Liverpool had  the highest Covid-19 death rate outside the capital .  It is unlikely that Richie contracted Covid-19 at the match; he did not become ill for two weeks. But those who did get it left the stadium and spread it onwards, to their partners and flatmates, who passed the virus on again to the classrooms, gyms, nail bars and supermarkets of Liverpool. “There will have been concentric circles of infection outwards, like throwing stones on a pond,” says Ashton.   Ashton was not the only person to express concerns before the match went ahead. “It was clear to us at the outset that there was no leadership or public prevention measures being taken by the government,” says Joe Blott, from Liverpool’s supporters union Spirit of Shankly. At a meeting with council officials and club representatives the Monday before the game, Spirit of Shankly raised concerns about the match going ahead. “We spoke to officials at the club and they said they were following the government guidance,” he says. Blott attended the game that night. The pubs around Anfield were packed.  At 8pm on 11 March, the Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, and his team walked out of the tunnel on to the pitch. A few fans reached out to shake Klopp’s hand; with a look of extreme irritation,  he upbraided them and batted them away . The crowd roared. The game commenced. It would be the last major football match played in England for a long time.  ***  The Barlow Arms is a short walk from Anfield, up Sleepers Hill and along the perimeter of Stanley Park, famous in the city as the dividing line between the grounds of Liverpool and Everton. Only no one calls the pub that. It is known as the Dark House, on account of the large shadow that falls across the pub’s exterior as the sun sets. It is a working-class pub whose regulars are a mixture of Everton and Liverpool fans. For the bigger games – only the finals, really – the publicans, Sandra and Tony McCormack, 67 and 70, deck the bar in the colours of whichever team is playing.  As he walked to the Dark House after the game, Richie called Jamie, who had been watching at home. It was a routine of theirs: they always debriefed after a match. Liverpool played well, they agreed, but Atlético put up a stunning defence to win 3-2 and dump Liverpool out of the competition. Richie was optimistic about their Premier League prospects, though. “He said: ‘I think we’re going to win the league,’” Jamie remembers.  Inside the Dark House, the bar manager, Elaine McCormack, 47, was waiting for the football crowd to pile in. Richie was a regular; Elaine had known him since she was 14 and started helping her mum and dad behind the bar. When Elaine’s daughter Connie, 20, served him, he would tip her a pound coin as she handed him his Carling and say: “Here you are, my little mate.”         At the crematorium, they played You’ll Never Walk Alone. Outside, everyone sang along – even the Everton fans       Richie always came into the Dark House on Sunday afternoons, after he had finished running his granddaughter, Nicole, 16, around town. Richie adored Nicole and talked about her constantly. After he dropped her off, he would sit and watch the horse racing with John, occasionally running out of the pub to place wagers at the betting shop around the corner. Sometimes, if it was quiet, Elaine would come over to their table, which would be covered in betting slips. “I’d say: ‘No one winning on this table?’” Elaine recalls. “He’d say: ‘Not today. I backed the favourite!”  Elaine saw Richie come in that evening after the game, although she can’t remember if she served him. She may have swerved him: Richie was always a pain to serve, because he held the kitty for his friends and placed huge orders, often eight or nine pints at a time. He always tried to skip the queue, too – the perks of being a regular. He always got away with it, too, because everyone knew Richie at the Dark House and everyone liked him. “He was always polite, Richie,” says Sandra. “He’d never walk past you without saying hello. Never ever. He’d always let on to you, no matter what.”  While Richie drank his Carling, Ashton appeared on Newsnight. “I’m tearing my hair out really with this … you’ve got 3,000 supporters in town, staying overnight in Liverpool, drinking in the bars, and a proportion of those will be corona-positive. We will now have people being infected tonight in Liverpool because of that.”  At 11pm, last orders, Elaine called out to Richie as he was leaving. “I said: ‘Ta-ra, I’ll see you Sunday,’” Elaine remembers. Richie nodded.  ***  The day after Liverpool’s Champions League exit,  Scotland and Ireland announced that they would ban mass events . The day after that, almost all British football was postponed.  On 12 March, the day after the game, Mary took the bus into town. She overheard a Wetherspoon’s employee telling her friend about work last night. “She said: ‘I can’t believe what this government has done! They let 3,000 Spanish supporters into this city … There’s going to be a pandemic here, mark my words,’” Mary remembers.  Sitting behind them, Mary thought: “My Richie was at the match.” She told herself that it could not be as bad as the girl was letting on. “But them words were the truest words I ever heard in my life,” Mary says.  When Richie got ill, his decline was rapid. On 26 March, he began to complain of a cold. Mary called the GP, who asked Richie to cough down the line. The GP said it was not coronavirus. The following day, Mary changed the bedsheets and found that they were wringing wet with sweat. On 1 April, Mary called the GP again. She prescribed Richie antibiotics, which a neighbour dropped off. He took the tablets and went to bed in the spare room. “Just after 2am, I hear this heavy breathing, like a ghost wailing,” says Mary. “I fall out of bed and run in.” Richie was stricken, gasping for air. She called an ambulance. The paramedics tell Mary that they are taking Richie to hospital.  
‘It broke my heart, Liverpool winning the title. He’d have been jumping through the ceiling’ ... Mary and Jamie Mawson.  Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian   “I really thought in my mind that they would send him home,” says Mary. She gave Richie £10, for a cab fare, in case he was discharged before Jamie could collect him. The paramedics wanted to wheel Richie to the ambulance, but he refused. He walked down the stairs, a paramedic holding an oxygen canister behind him, and stepped into the ambulance. Mary watched from the window as the ambulance pulled away in the dark, then sat down on the sofa and wept. She did not know that this would be the last time she would see her husband of 49 years.  ***  We do not know for certain when Richie contracted Covid-19. What we do know is that, on the night of the match at Anfield, Covid-19 was silently replicating across the UK. It was finding its way into care homes, hospitals and schools. Giving evidence to parliament on 10 June, Ferguson said that  infection rates were doubling every three to four days in mid-March . “Had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by a half,” he said.  After Richie became infected with Covid-19, the virus burrowed into the cells of his upper respiratory tract and replicated. His immune system was not able to fight off the virus and went into overdrive. His lungs began to fill with water, which is why Richie could not breathe when he spoke to Jamie on the afternoon of 3 April. “He was saying: ‘I can’t get my breath,’” Jamie remembers. “I said: ‘Dad, leave it, we’ll phone you back.’”  When Jamie called back the following day, Richie was on a ventilator. He would remain on the ventilator for more than two weeks.  ***  As Richie lay in hospital and the scale of the loss of life was becoming clear, the finger-pointing began. On 2 April, Matthew Ashton, the incoming public health director for Liverpool,  told the Guardian       that  “it was not the right decision to stage the match”. On 19 April, the mayor of Madrid  admitted that it was a “mistake”  to allow Atlético fans into the UK. On 20 April, a reporter from the Liverpool Echo, which had been investigating the city’s  escalating death toll , asked at a Downing Street press conference whether the government should have cancelled the game. “That is certainly an interesting hypothesis you raise,”  responded Prof Dame Angela McLean , the UK government’s deputy chief scientific adviser.  On 14 April, Jamie received a call from the staff at Aintree hospital. Richie was not improving and the hospital wanted to take him off the ventilator. Jamie pleaded with the doctors for more time and they agreed to give Richie two more days. On 16 April, they called back. It was time for the family to say their goodbyes. A nurse video-called Mary, Jamie, his wife Christine and Nicole, who were assembled at Jamie’s and Christine’s house.  Nurses tried to sit Richie upright, but he was unconscious, with tubes coming from his mouth and nose. His mouth was agape and his face bloated. The call lasted only 10 minutes, because “everyone was screaming and crying”, says Mary. “To say goodbye over a video link – I have never gone through an emotion like that,” says Jamie. “I wouldn’t wish it on my worst enemy. Words cannot describe it. How can you say goodbye over a video link?”  After the call, the family begged the hospital staff not to leave Richie alone. A nurse promised to hold his hand through the night. Richie died at about 3am.  ***  Richie’s funeral was held on 2 May. It was beautiful, even if the lockdown restrictions meant that only 10 people could attend. As the hearse pulled out from Richie’s home in Kirkdale, his neighbours applauded him down the street. On the way to the crematorium, the hearse waited outside Anfield for two minutes.  
‘I liked everything about him. He was just a good person’ ... Mary and Richie.  Photograph: Christopher Thomond/The Guardian   As they were approaching the crematorium, Mary turned to Jamie and said: “There’s a lot of people at that bus stop.” When they got closer, they realised that the socially distanced crowd of 200 people was there for Richie. The funeral director turned on the speakers, so that the crowd outside could hear. When the coffin disappeared behind the curtain, strewn in roses – red, of course – they played You’ll Never Walk Alone. Outside, everyone sang along with their hands in the air, even the Everton fans.  Leaving the crematorium, the mourners were silent. Jamie suggested they clap the well-wishers, so they started clapping them. They clapped back and then everyone was clapping. “It was lovely,” says Mary. Richie’s ashes now sit in a wooden casket with a Liverpool crest on it at Jamie’s house. When Mary dies, she will be cremated and their ashes will be buried together.  In the weeks after Richie’s death, Jamie and Mary grew angrier. By this point, the fault lines in the government’s handling of the pandemic were so big that you could see them from space. “The government acted too slow on everything,” says Mary. “And now they’re telling lies. They’re patting themselves on the back about how well they’ve handled things. They must think people are foolish enough to believe them.” At a Downing Street press conference on 30 April,  Boris Johnson defended his decision  not to lock down the UK sooner. “We did the right thing at the right time,” he insisted.  A team from Liverpool John Moores University and the University of Liverpool is assessing whether Liverpool’s death toll is linked to the game, at the behest of Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool. Liverpool FC have indicated that they will cooperate with this investigation. Increased local death tolls have been linked to  Wolves’ game against Espanyol  on 20 February,  the Manchester derby  on 8 March and  Cheltenham festival  between 10 and 13 March.  Almost everyone in Liverpool, it seems, knows someone who has died. “People were saying: ‘I don’t know anyone who’s got it,’” says Mary. “And then, all of a sudden, everyone had got it and everyone was dying.” At the beginning of May,  the death rate in Liverpool among those hospitalised with Covid-19 was nearly double the national average . As of 9 August,  1,248       people  have died of Covid-19 in Merseyside hospitals.   “If you go back to Hillsborough, when you have a cockup, it’s not normally one thing going wrong, but a number of things going wrong and they all come together,” says Ashton. As with Hillsborough, the decision to let the Atlético game go ahead was a baton relay of missteps, each mistake passed off to the next hand, but all converging at the same time. “You had the epidemic in Spain, you had inactivity at a national level, you had the financial pressures for the game to go ahead and the passion for the game in the city,” Ashton says.  “What is the job of a minister for culture?” Ashton asks. “Shouldn’t they be providing oversight? What about Uefa? The club itself could have been more proactive.” Uefa, the administrative body for European football, which organised the Liverpool-Atlético game, distanced itself from the decision to go ahead with the game in a statement  to the Liverpool Echo . “Any decision taken by Uefa which led to matches being postponed or played behind closed doors was taken in close collaboration with, and based on decisions made by, the relevant national authorities in the respective host countries,” it said. “Uefa did not receive any advice or request from local authorities to play this match behind closed doors.”  Already, there are indications that the government is blaming the scientists. Appearing on Sky News in June, the health minister Helen Whately said: “We follow the scientific guidance as to what is the right thing to do.” Sky’s presenter, Kay Burley, responded: “You can’t stick this on the scientists.”  “Well, I can,” Whately said .         We’re pushing for an inquiry for all the people who lost their lives because of the game. And we'll get one   Jamie Mawson    Across Liverpool, there are calls for an investigation into the government’s handling of the pandemic. “There needs to be an inquiry into whether lockdown came soon enough to prevent these large scale gatherings,” says Liverpool’s metro mayor, Steve Rotheram. “We’ve been hard hit.” Jamie and Mary back the calls, too. “I’m not just doing this for my dad, but for all the people who lost their lives because of the game,” says Jamie. “That’s why we’re pushing for an inquiry. And we’ll get one.”  This month, MPs on the  home affairs select committee published a damning report  that said failure to impose special border measures, such as mandatory self-isolation and targeted testing, on people arriving in the UK from countries such as Spain in the run-up to the Covid-19 lockdown was “a serious mistake” that significantly increased the pace and scale of the epidemic. “The UK was almost unique in having no border checks or quarantine arrangements at that time,” said Yvette Cooper, the committee chair. Despite numerous requests for the scientific evidence that backed the decision-making at the time, the committee said none was provided.  As with Hillsborough, the pandemic has scarred the city. “Scousers have long memories,” says Ashton. “It will be in there.” It may be years before the city recovers. “Liverpool is a community,” says Mary. “We’ve all got a sense of humour. It’s a city of laughter. But I don’t think there will be much laughter after this. It took the city years to come to terms with Hillsborough. And now this.”  On 25 June, after 30 years of disappointment,  Liverpool won the Premier League . Thousands of fans gathered at Anfield to celebrate, in contravention of social distancing guidelines.  At Jamie’s house, the family watched as  Manchester City’s 2-1 defeat to Chelsea  crowned Liverpool the champions of England. It was what Richie had been waiting for for decades, but he was not around to see it. “It broke my heart, Liverpool winning,” says Mary. “He’d have been jumping through the ceiling. He’d have been singing all The Fields of Anfield Road, with his terrible voice.” They wept. “To think that he couldn’t see that happen with his own two eyes after 30 years,” says Jamie. “That was hard to take.”  And then they dried their eyes and raised a glass to Richie. “We talked about the lovely memories,” says Mary. “The way he was. How loved he was. And how loved we were from him.”   

Fourteen-day quarantine restrictions for travellers from Spain will remain in force in Scotland,  Nicola Sturgeon  has announced, prompting calls for an urgent review from airline and tourist industry chiefs. 
The first minister confirmed that Scotland would provide air corridors with 57 countries on the “reduced risk” lists agreed by the UK government. But while Scotland had approved all the countries rated green on the UK  government’s traffic light system , she said she could not give air corridors to Spain or Serbia, countries on the amber list that have a higher prevalence of coronavirus than  Scotland . 
English holidaymakers will be able to  travel to Spain without quarantining  on their return when the new travel arrangements come into force from 10 July. The Welsh government has still to decide whether to follow England’s measures. 
Which countries can UK holidaymakers visit without restrictions on arrival?

Sturgeon noted that, as reported by the joint biosecurity centre, the prevalence of the virus in Spain is around 330 people in every 100,000. “That means the rate reported for Spain, while less than twice the rate for the UK as a whole, is more than 10 times the estimated rate for  Scotland ,” she said. 
She said she hoped to lift the exemption for  Spain  as soon as possible and would review the decision on 20 July. 
Sturgeon said: “One of our biggest risk factors as we suppress the virus here is the importation of new cases to Scotland.” She told travellers they could not “get round the requirement to quarantine in Scotland by flying to or from an airport in England”. 
“Public Health Scotland will have access to contact details for people staying in Scotland, regardless of whether an individual arrives in Glasgow, Manchester or London, and it will carry out sample checks,” she said. 
The chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Marc Crothall, welcomed the further clarity, but said excluding Spain from the list of air bridges was “a blow to the aviation sector and our tourism industry”. He said that airlines having to abandon plans to restart Spanish routes could lead to mass redundancies. 
Derek Provan, chief executive of AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen, Glasgow and Southampton airports, described Spain as a “glaring omission” and said he would be working to bring Scottish travel advice in line with that in England. 
“We’ve requested a meeting with the Scottish government to discuss what further measures could be put in place that would allow the lifting of restrictions and prevent airlines from cancelling routes to what is one of Scotland’s most popular and important tourism destinations,” he said.  

A council’s plans to remove a statue of the founder of the Scout movement amid fears that it would be targeted by anti-racist activists were thwarted when it was surrounded by dozens of locals refusing to allow it to be taken away. 
Former scouts were among those who formed a ring around the statue of Robert Baden-Powell, a divisive figure who has been accused of support for Adolf Hitler, on the quayside in  Poole . They vowed that they would not let either council workers or activists get to the statue. 
The flags of St George and Dorset were draped over the monument, and a woman held out a sign reading: “British history matters.” 
Bournemouth , Christchurch and Poole council said it was not able to remove the statue on Thursday because it had misjudged the depth of the foundations, but privately council leaders admitted that they had no chance of removing it because of the crowd. 
The council said security guards would be stationed around the clock at the statue until it could be removed and insisted it would be put back as soon as it was judged that the threat against it had passed. 
The statue was installed in 2008 and faces Brownsea Island in Poole harbour, where the Scout movement began. In 2010, declassified MI5 files revealed that Baden-Powell was invited to meet Hitler after holding friendly talks about forming closer ties with the Hitler Youth organisation. He has also been accused of holding racist and homophobic views.

Cllr Mark Howell, the council’s deputy leader, said: “Our decision to temporarily remove the statue of Lord Baden-Powell from Poole Quay was taken following the listing of the statue on a website detailing potential targets for protesters. This listing placed the much-loved statue at risk of damage or even destruction. We made the decision quickly in order to protect it. 
“We know that local people feel proud of Lord Baden-Powell’s and the Scout movement’s links with Poole, and that some people feel that we would be giving in to the protesters by temporarily removing the statue. However, we feel it is responsible to protect it for future generations to enjoy and respect. 
“We will not be removing the statue today [Thursday] as the foundations are deeper than originally envisaged and we need further discussions with contractors on the best way to remove it safely. 
“Although we cannot say when any temporary removal may take place, we will be providing 24-hour security until it is either removed or the threat diminishes. Should the statue be removed temporarily, barring unforeseen circumstances we will return it to the quay as soon as the threat level subsides.” 
After the  statue of the slave trader Edward Colston  was hauled down and dumped into the harbour in Bristol, the Baden-Powell monument was one of more than 60 that appeared on a “Topple the Racists” hit list. The listing claimed that Baden-Powell “committed atrocities against the Zulus in his military career and was a Nazi/fascist sympathiser”. 
On Wednesday, the council announced the Baden-Powell statue would be removed on Thursday and put into storage. 
The leader of the council, Vikki Slade, said at that time: “While famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powell’s life that are considered less worthy of commemoration. 
“Therefore, we are removing the statue so that we can properly involve all relevant communities and groups in discussions about its future, including whether a more educational presentation of his life in a different setting might be more appropriate.” 
She added on Twitter that the decision was taken after a “threat”, explaining: “It’s literally less than 3 metres from the sea, so is at huge risk.” 
By the time council contractors arrived on Thursday morning to move the statue, local Tory MPs had protested and thousands of people signed an online petition demanding that it be left in place.

The removal of the statue of Lord Baden Powell from Poole is a huge error of judgement. Very concerned by the idea it is on advice from  @dorsetpolice . Urgent clarity needed. Put it back. 
June 10, 2020 
Owen Diffey, 19, a former assistant scout leader, said he would stand guard to stop the statue being removed. He said: “I’ll be here until they try to remove it. I am disgusted at what’s going on. They are making something political of a non-political organisation that stands for nothing but equality.” 
Len Banister, 78, who became a cub aged 8 in 1949, said: “How can this happen without public consultation? So many of the adventures and joy in my life have been because of Baden-Powell and the Scouting movement. They shouldn’t take it down. I will fight them off.” 
Matthew Trott and Christopher Arthur, who are part of the Rover Scout movement aimed at adults, travelled from Cwmbran, south Wales, to express their support for the statue.

Trott said: “There have been vicious rumours of Baden-Powell but they are not true at all. He started the foundation I love. I have been a scout my whole life since I was six. Scouting is my whole life, so he is my hero.” 
A former girl guide, Viv Endecott, said: “He’s done more good to the world than virtually any other individual. Anyone who destroys a statue should face the full force of the law.” 
A spokesman for the Scouts said the organisation was aware that the statue was being removed. “We look forward to discussing this matter with Poole council to make an informed decision on what happens next,” he said. 

Seven men have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to hijack the oil tanker that was stormed by members of the Special Boat Service (SBS) off the coast of the Isle of Wight on Sunday night.  Hampshire police said they had detained the men – who are understood to be Nigerian nationals – for allegedly “seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force”. The seven are being held at police stations across the county, where they are being questioned.    The SBS, operating at the request of Hampshire police, seized control of the Nave Andromeda and secured the crew in an operation lasting around nine minutes on Sunday evening.  Navios Tanker Management, the Greek company that owns the vessel, said stowaways had boarded the tanker in Lagos, and that as the ship approached England its captain had radioed seeking help.  “The UK authorities had been advised by the master that stowaways had been found on board and that he was concerned for the safety of the crew due to the increasingly hostile behaviour of the stowaways,” Navios said in a statement.  Hampshire police said the men had been arrested subject to section 9(1) and (3) of the Aviation and Maritime and Security Act 1990. Officers will consider whether there is enough evidence to bring criminal charges against some or all of them, and whether to seek to deport them.  It remains unclear precisely what happened on the vessel on Sunday. One source said crew members locked themselves in the control room of the ship for their own safety until the special forces arrived.  Defence sources sought to justify the deployment of the SBS, part of Britain’s special forces. One insider said a “threat to life” had been communicated and was “believed to be a very real possibility”.  A recording of the mayday call made on an open channel by the ship’s captain and obtained by the Times suggests he feared the tanker’s control room was surrounded, saying he saw “four persons port side” and “two of them starboard side” of the bridge. “I try to keep them calm, but I need immediately, immediately agency assistance,” the captain said.   On Sunday night, the Ministry of Defence described the situation onboard as “a suspected hijacking”. But Bob Sanguinetti, the chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, said he thought that was not the case. “Nothing at this stage suggests that this was hijacking, and in fact hijacking of this nature is extremely uncommon,” he told the BBC.  Chris Parry, a retired rear admiral, said: “They will have wanted to send a message here: if you try to take control of a tanker, there will be a response.”  The 228-metre tanker had been expected to dock in Southampton on Sunday to pick up a cargo of petrol, but its course in the Channel became erratic, prompting calls for an intervention as it passed the south-east coast of the Isle of Wight.  The SBS, based in Poole, Dorset, is the unit trained to deal with incidents at sea. Commandos from the unit were deployed and the tanker was reported by the MoD as being secured at 8.15pm. Hampshire police said on Sunday that all 22 crew of the Nave Andromeda were safe and well.  The vessel left Lagos on 6 October and made two stops on its voyage, anchoring off the Canary Islands and off the French coast just south of Saint-Nazaire in Brittany.  The incident comes after a summer in which the number of migrants crossing the Channel has  rapidly increased . According to a PA Media analysis, by the end of September 7,000 migrants had arrived in the UK in small boats this year – more than three times the number of arrivals by the same route in the whole of 2019.  Incidents such as the one on Sunday are extremely rare, and it is unclear if the seven men had planned to try to claim asylum in the UK before the ship was seized.  In January  four stowaways  who secretly boarded a ship in Nigeria in 2018 were jailed for affray and two of the four were also found guilty of threats to kill.  A court heard that they “ran amok” on the container ship and demanded to be dropped off in the UK when the ship reached the Thames estuary. During the trial, the judge, Nigel Lickley QC, said it was an “unusual case” the like of which he had never come across before.   

Seven Nigerian men detained after British special services  stormed an oil tanker  off the Isle of Wight have been bailed, police have said.  The raid was carried out by around 16 members of the  Special Boat Service (SBS) , backed by airborne snipers, who secured the Nave Andromeda tanker in around nine minutes.    It came after reports that stowaways had boarded the vessel and attempted to hijack it.  The operation was authorised by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, on Sunday night after a tense 10-hour stand-off.  On Thursday, Hampshire police said: “Seven men have been bailed for their part in the maritime security incident that took place on board the Nave Andromeda off the coast of the Isle of Wight on Sunday October 25.  “The seven arrested men, who are all Nigerian nationals, have been bailed in relation to the criminal investigation whilst investigators continue their inquiries, but will now remain detained under Border Force powers.”  Hampshire police previously said the force was alerted to concerns over the welfare of the crew of the 748ft (228 metre) Nave Andromeda soon after 10am on Sunday as the ship headed towards  Southampton , having set sail from Lagos in Nigeria.  The ship’s operator, Navios Tanker Management, said the stowaways had boarded the Liberian-flagged tanker in Lagos.  The company revealed on Monday evening that the master, a Greek national, had remained on the bridge throughout the SBS operation in order to stay in contact with them and continue the safe navigation of the ship.  All other members of the crew went to a secure area on the vessel, except for the engineer – another Greek national – who remained in the engine room taking instructions from the master.  The SBS is the elite maritime counter-terrorism unit of the  Royal Navy , with most of its personnel Royal Marine Commandos, whose operations are highly classified and not officially confirmed.  On Sunday, four military helicopters – thought to have included two Merlin Mk4s, a Wildcat and a Chinook – took 40 personnel to the scene of the suspected hijack aboard the Nave Andromeda and about 16 members of the SBS boarded the vessel.  Before the armed forces action, Hampshire police said the vessel had been located around six miles off the coast of Bembridge on the Isle of Wight, adding: “It was reported that a number of stowaways were on board and they had made verbal threats towards the crew. No one has been reported injured.”  An exclusion zone with a three-mile radius was placed around the vessel, with two coastguard helicopters spotted circling the ship in the afternoon.   

Residents evacuated from properties in Ironbridge due to flooding are facing further misery with wet weather expected to cause disruption on Thursday after flood defences were breached along the banks of the River Severn, forcing householders and businesspeople to flee their properties. 
A yellow weather warning for snow and ice has been issued for much of the Midlands including the Severn in Shropshire.  Flooding  along parts of the Severn, which remained close to its highest levels in some areas, is likely until at least Sunday, the Environment Agency has said. 
On Wednesday the water overwhelmed the flood barriers at Ironbridge, in Shropshire, leading to an emergency evacuation and promoting concern that the world heritage site would suffer serious damage. A little further down the river, at Bridgnorth, there was flooding in some areas that had not been inundated for a century. Water also breached the temporary flood barriers in the Worcestershire town of Bewdley, causing homes there to be evacuated. 
Thirty eight properties were affected but about a dozen people refused to leave their homes. One man who had to be rescued on a boat by fire crews said floodwater in his house had reached knee height before he left. 
Ironbridge bore the brunt on Wednesday. As 400 tonnes of water per second flowed through, the barriers were pushed back, allowing water to seep through and putting properties in the Wharfage area at risk.

A drone was used to survey a 500 metre section of the flood defences after residents reported a loud bang when the barrier was shunted into a kerbstone by the fast-flowing Severn. 
Mark Sitton-Kent, the director of operations for the Environment Agency, said the barrier had been undermined by the sheer volume of water. He said: “It’s not safe to go behind the barrier so we use the drone to fly in and examine the barrier.” 
Ch Supt Tom Harding, of West Mercia police, said: “We’ve got water that has started to come underneath the flood barriers and in areas it appears that it is buckling.” Police said virtually everyone had agreed to leave. 
Shaun Davies, the Labour leader of Telford and Wrekin council, urged people to stay away from Ironbridge. 
He said: “The barriers are buckling, overwhelmed by the pure volume of water in the River Severn and the prolonged pressure they have been under.” Davies also expressed concern that senior government ministers had not visited the area.

As well as the personal trauma the flooding was causing, the chair of the world heritage site steering group, Marion Blockley, expressed concern about what it could be doing to the historic spot. 
“The world heritage site is not just the iron bridge. It is the former workers’ cottages, the warehouses, the industrial buildings, the other nearby villages,” she said. “The worry is that floods like this are putting the site at risk.” 
Even businesses that have not been flooded are struggling. Richard Eley, whose family runs a pork pie shop and a cafe in Ironbridge, said the flooding was devastating. “This is a key time of year for us and the place is empty,” he said. Chris Warren did not bother opening the Copper Fox gift shop. “There’s nobody around – it’s not worth opening up,” he said.

The problem for Ironbridge is that the water is squeezed into a narrow gorge. Firefighters, an ambulance control unit and mountain rescue teams stood by as the evacuation took place. 
Shropshire council was trying to rehouse the evacuated people and a local hotel was among places offering free rooms to those who had been displaced. 
At Bridgnorth, where there are no permanent defences, sandbags were being placed along the riverbank to try to stem the flow.

Nick Bevon, the landlord of the Bassa Villa pub and restaurant, said that his cellar had flooded for the first time in a century. “We know we’ll never get flood defences,” he said. “There aren’t enough properties to protect here. We just have to carry on.” 
Teacher Sally Hebbard is living in an Airbnb after being forced out of her riverside home with her husband and daughter. She said: “Our houses are under a foot of water, still rising. Two of the neighbours sadly couldn’t afford insurance. Shropshire council made no contact whatsoever with us, either prior to or during the evacuation process. They offered no assistance, not a single solitary sandbag was forthcoming. 
“Now I sit listening to PMQs I hear Boris saying there will be a quick £500 and a further £5,000 available to us, but when I called the council I was met with a vague answer that they are waiting for central government to give them further information. So no immediate £500 then? 
“All other towns along the Severn have flood defences, why do Shropshire county council and this government continue to ignore this beautiful, historic market town?”

Russell Bate, whose home is a few metres from the flood water, said it was a disgrace that the prime minister had not visited. “We’re really struggling here. Where is he?” 
Others were more phlegmatic. Victor Flavell had just finished building a sandbag wall at his front door. “I think I’m just about high enough to miss it but we’ll have to see,” he said.

More than 3,000 sandbags were handed out in Bridgnorth. More than 10,000 have been distributed across Shropshire. 
The Met Office has warned of further showers across the UK on Wednesday, followed by even more rainfall on Thursday and Friday. 
Its forecaster John Griffiths said between 5mm and 10mm could fall on the Severn’s source in the Welsh hills. 
Across England as of Thursday morning there were 92 flood warnings in place, meaning flooding should be expected, and 132 flood alerts, meaning possible flooding.

After more than half a century of living in Southsea,  Portsmouth , with its unpredictable British weather, shingle beaches and Victorian pier, relocation to the Gulf state of Oman might take some adjustment. 
But for Jamshid bin Abdullah al-Said the 91-year-old last sultan of Zanzibar, it was the next best thing to going home. 
Zanzibar locator 
The man who ruled the tiny Indian Ocean archipelago until he was deposed in a bloody revolt in January 1964 finally arrived in Muscat last week. Multiple earlier requests from the sultan to be allowed to live in the Gulf state had been rejected by the government on security grounds. 
But now his request to retire in Oman was granted due to his age,  a family member in Muscat told the Abu Dhabi-based   the    National  . “He always wanted to spend his last days in the country of his ancestors and now he is happy he can do that.” A government official declined to comment. 
Abdullah al-Said is distantly related to the present sultan of  Oman , Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, with whom he shares the same lineage of royalty. 
The ex-sultan’s long and unlikely journey from the palm-fringed islands of Zanzibar via the crazy golf courses and amusement parks of Southsea to Muscat came after his short-lived reign ended in revolution. 
He became sultan of Zanzibar after the death of his father in July 1963. In December that year, the islands – 22 miles off the coast of  Tanzania  – were granted independence from Britain. Just one month later the sultan was deposed in an insurrection, and a republic was proclaimed.

He fled Zanzibar on the royal yacht as his palace was seized by rebels. After being refused permission to settle in Oman, he flew to Britain with an entourage of 61 relatives, friends and household staff. 
Two weeks later, the  New York Times  reported that the sultan’s impecunious state obliged him to move “from his pillared London hotel in the shadow of Buckingham palace to a modest hotel in Bayswater on the unfashionable side of Hyde Park”.  
In May 1964, the British government made a payment of £100,000 to the former sultan, the paper reported. 
The sum allowed him to settle in a semi-detached house on a quiet street in Southsea, Hampshire, where the contrast with Zanzibar’s white powder beaches and crystal waters must have been striking and perhaps a little painful. 
Over the 56 years he lived in the UK seaside resort, the sultan drew little attention. Ned Donovan, a writer who has followed the sultan’s story, said: “I couldn’t find anyone locally who knew he was there. He never spoke to the press, he just went very low key.” 
. 
These days, the 1.3 million mainly Muslim population of Zanzibar, now a semi-autonomous region of Tanzania, is ruled by President Ali Mohamed Shein. 
Human rights organisations have criticised the state’s  criminalisation of gay men , who face up to 25 years in prison. A recently opened museum dedicated to Queen singer Freddie Mercury, who died from an Aids-related illness in 1991,  glosses over the star’s sexuality . 
Mercury, whose real name was Farrokh Bulsara, was born in Stone Town, the historic quarter of Zanzibar’s capital, but his family moved to the UK in the aftermath of the 1964 revolution. 
In the years that followed, thousands of Zanzibar citizens relocated to Oman – including the former sultan’s seven children and two of his siblings. Abdullah, although banned from ever returning to Zanzibar, is at least now reunited with his immediate family. 

T   he true consequences of the coronavirus lockdown on employment are becoming clear, as official figures show that almost three-quarters of a million jobs  have been shed from company payrolls  since March.   Older and younger workers have been the hardest hit by job cuts, and many people of all ages have taken new jobs in different industries to make ends meet, while others are underemployed and struggling to pay the bills despite being in work.    While the number of employees losing their jobs has begun to slow, there are fears that the ending of the furlough scheme in October  could lead to further redundancies  – with a report finding that as many as a third of UK employers  expect to cut jobs .  Essa Ali, 36, gas engineer, Manchester  Recently qualified gas engineer and father-of-three Ali has been unable to find work in his trade throughout the pandemic – despite offering his services for free to gain further experience.  
Essa Ali said he has offered to work for free to gain momentum.  Photograph: Guardian Community   “I’m on all the apps applying for jobs non-stop, but it’s rejection after rejection,” he said. “First thing I do in the morning is have a cup of tea and look for work, constantly applying.”  Ali, who passed his level 3 domestic gas engineer tests earlier this year, believes more should be done to help people into work after they retrain, “even if it’s as an apprentice on lower wages, so we can start supporting ourselves and not be on welfare”.  His family is receiving universal credit (UC) but are struggling, and Ali, who previously worked as a waiter, is in the process of selling his car as he cannot afford the insurance repayments.  “I just don’t know what to do,” he said. “I’ve paid taxes for 12 years and I’ll do anything to get work. There’s a tonne of people who have been made redundant and everyone is applying for the same jobs.”  Lauren Cottrell, 23, shop assistant, London  In April, Cottrell was among about 900 people who were made redundant after British brand Cath Kidston was sold off by its administrators. Following an outcry,  the company agreed to hand over three weeks of back pay , but this was scant consolation.  “We were given no notice of our redundancy and were charged for the phone call telling of us our job loss,” claimed Cottrell, who lives with her parents and is now returning to university in September to study for an MA.   “It felt like such a betrayal from a company we’d worked so hard for, for just above the minimum wage. It really brought home how little some corporations care for the individuals who create and sustain them.”

Terms and conditions          Since losing her job, she has been constantly applying for a variety of jobs, with no luck. “There weren’t very many before lockdown, and now it’s just ridiculous,” she said. “Its mainly caring and nursing positions, often at night, as well as supermarkets. Most of my friends are unemployed as well.”  Pete Brown, 38, Liverpool, corporate travel agency  The travel industry began to feel the impacts of coronavirus in January when flights to the Far East were first affected, and Brown fears it could be up to three years until normal service resumes. He hopes he can find a new job before then.  
British Airways planes grounded at Bournemouth International airport in April.  Photograph: James Marsh/Rex/Shutterstock   “My 12-month contract was ending on 31 March and I was not offered furlough, so I fell through the cracks of the scheme,” he said. “It’s been frustrating and worrying financially.”  With the travel industry “decimated” by the steep fall in air travel, Brown is now looking for work in any sector. He no longer bothers looking on LinkedIn, because all he can see is his network of acquaintances losing their jobs.  “I’m constantly applying for any relevant positions and networking with people,” he said. “But there’s not many roles around.”  Until he finds a new job, the father of two will continue to receive UC while he has been forced to put his mortgage on hold for three months, having recently applied for another quarter. “Its quite tough at the moment,” he said. “I’ve never been out of work since I left school.”  Jack Park, 25, Preston, digital marketing  
Jack Park moved into his parents’ house when he could no longer pay his rent.  Photograph: Guardian Community   Park lost his job during the first week of lockdown, days before the announcement of the job retention scheme. His boss later allegedly refused to retrospectively furlough anyone.  “It was a couple of weeks away from my birthday. They let all relatively new employees go to save costs because of Covid-19. It was a bit of a knee-jerk reaction.  “We were told at five to five, then I left. There was no process. It was just, ‘See you later.’ I got in touch with them when the scheme was announced, but they basically said, ‘We’ve let you go now, fend for yourself.’”  As a result, Park has moved back in with his parents after he became unable to pay his rent, despite using up his savings and signing up for UC. He has had numerous interviews, but employers have eventually told him they are not actually hiring at this time.  “That’s where the frustration is,” he said. “They genuinely put these job postings out there, then the market takes another hit and they can’t employ.”  He said the only jobs he had seen available were in software development or entry-level jobs with a £16,000 starting salary. “I’m just looking to do anything now to get some money in,” he said.   

High winds have added to widespread flooding as Storm Bella continued to wreak havoc across much of the UK. In many coastal areas, communities were forced to erect flood defences to counter the impact of waves whipped up by gusts that reached 100mph overnight.  People in the north-west awoke to sleet and snow showers on Sunday, while the Met Office issued 112 flood warnings across a swath of land from Cornwall to Kent.    Two of the warnings were severe – at the Cogenhoe Mill caravan site near Northampton, and on the banks of the River Nene near Billing Aquadrome – after days of wintry weather during the Christmas break, while an imminent cold snap with icy and wintry conditions was forecast.  The highest wind speed was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight, reaching 106mph overnight on Saturday. Gusts of 83mph were recorded at the coastal village of Aberdaron in north Wales, and regions on the south coast of England, including Dorset, got close to 80mph.

Photograph: Phil Rees/Rex/Shutterstock   Hundreds in the Plymouth and Truro were left without power as electricity lines collapsed. Similar power losses were recorded in Cardiff, Swansea, Telford in Shropshire, and Nottingham.  The Met Office warned of the risks posed by flying debris and the damage caused to exposed buildings.  The Newquay police response team in Cornwall said Storm Bella was so severe it was “throwing trees over the roads”.  The North Yorkshire fire and rescue service said they used a boat to rescue two men and two dogs from a vehicle stuck in floodwater in Hawes at 12.37am on Sunday.  In Aysgarth, a man and a woman were also rescued by boat from the roof of their car at 2.40am after they drove into deep floodwater.  Firefighters walked a woman to safety through shallow water in Wensley at 3.35am after a minor collision while driving through floods.  In Hove, Sussex, a tree fell on to a £363,000 Rolls-Royce. Tree surgeons were called in to saw up the branches and lift them off the shattered vehicle with a hoist.  Some people managed to find new ways to enjoy themselves even at the height of the storm, including kayakers who took to new waters around the UK – among them Worcester racecourse and the flooded A1101 at Welney, Norfolk.  The disruption continued into Sunday morning when flooding on the tracks caused cancellations and delays.

Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA   All trains between Bournemouth and Southampton Central were stopped because of water on the line, Great Western Railway said, and one of the major lines into London was also blocked when a tree fell on the tracks in Haslemere, Surrey.  About 25mm of rain is due to fall on Sunday in parts of the south-west England and Wales, with up to 60mm on high ground.  Flood defences have been put in St Neots, Cambridgeshire, and extra pumps deployed to the Welches Dam and Soham Lodge areas.  Scotland, Northern Ireland, north Wales and parts of northern England are also subject to a yellow warning for snow and ice from Sunday night into Monday.

Photograph: Greg Blatchford/Rex/Shutterstock   In its early stages the storm forced people living next to the River Great Ouse in Bedfordshire to  flee their homes  on Christmas Day, as floodwater rose to dangerous levels.  On Sunday the Coral Welsh Grand National meeting at Chepstow was abandoned after 27mm of rain fell overnight.  In Cirencester, Gloucestershire, council officials ordered the distribution of sandbags as heavy rain caused flooding.  Through the evening and into Monday, meteorologists are warning the snow and ice could also pose a risk to more central and southern areas of England.  Further into the week and towards the New Year, conditions will remain cold with sunshine and the possibility of wintry showers, the Met Office said.

Sunday_s developments 
Some areas saw a month and a half’s rainfall in 24 hours and  gusts of more than 90 miles per hour  swept across the country on Sunday,  bringing widespread flooding.  
Some 539,000 people experienced a power cut on Sunday with 118,000 left without power by 4pm across the whole of the UK, according to Energy Networks. 
Flights, ferries and trains all saw cancellations and delays, while drivers faced treacherous conditions with  floodwater, fallen trees and other debris closing roads.  
Train passengers are being advised to check with operators before travelling as there are likely to be some cancellations to early trains as Network Rail engineers work through the night to assess the damage. 
Motorists are also warned to take care with continued disruption to the road network and tricky driving conditions likely to continue into rush hour. 
British Airways said there will be a “minor knock-on effect” to Monday’s schedule. 
Sporting fixtures were postponed  including Manchester City’s Premier League game against West Ham and England’s women’s Six Nations match against Scotland in Glasgow. 
More than 200 flood warnings were issued across England on Sunday, with the town of Appleby-in-Westmorland, in Cumbria, severely hit. 
The River Irwell burst its banks at Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, while areas including Blackpool, Whalley, Longton and Rossendale, were affected by flooding in Lancashire. 
The fastest gusts of 97 miles per hour were recorded on the Isle of Wight on Sunday, with 93 miles per hour winds hitting Aberdaron, a village at the tip of the Llyn Peninsula. 
Inland, Manchester Airport recorded gusts of 86 miles per hour, while 178mm of rain fell in Honister Pass, in Cumbria, in the 24 hours to 4pm on Sunday - around one-and-a-half times the average February rainfall of 112mm.

A further 70 reservists from the 4th Battalion the Yorkshire Regiment were sent to help. 
The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said: “Our armed forces are always ready to support local authorities and communities whenever they need it. 
“The rapid response of the army today will help with provision of flood relief to local communities in West Yorkshire. 
“The government won’t hesitate to use all means at its disposal to mitigate the effects of Storm Dennis.”

A teenager stabbed their mother more than 100 times before dialling 999 and calmly telling police to “bring a body bag”, an inquest heard.  Rowan Thompson, 17, had just returned from a jog with Joanna Thompson when they attacked her at her home in the Hampshire village of Hambledon.    The teenager strangled Ms Thompson, a 50-year-old speech therapist, in her living room until she fell unconscious before stabbing her in the neck, forehead and arm.  At 12.45pm on 1 July last year, Rowan phoned the police and announced: “I’ve just killed my mum … I strangled her and I’ve been stabbing her with various knives and whatnot.”  Rowan was due to stand trial at Winchester crown court in October but was found dead at a secure hospital in Greater Manchester a few days before. Police said the death was not suspicious.  Speaking outside court, Rowan’s father, Marc, claimed more could have been done for the teenager during stays at two mental health units before the attack. He said Rowan identified as non-binary but was placed into a unit that segregated boys and girls.  Mr Thompson said Rowan was “troubled” and had been failed by the system. He said Rowan had loved Ms Thompson “to bits” and knew the attack was wrong.  Before the attack, Rowan was never aggressive, liked fencing, climbing, the Rubik’s Cube and wanted to become an architect, Mr Thompson added.  The inquest was told that Rowan was visiting their mother for the weekend, having moved to live with their father, a magician, in Barnsley, south Yorkshire.  Rowan and their mother had “stressful” conversations about living arrangements on the night before her death, the inquest in Winchester was told.  In a clip of the 999 call played in court, the teenager can be heard saying: “I’ve just killed my mum. I need someone to arrest me as that’s what you do and an ambulance would be nice. I strangled her and I’ve been stabbing her with various knives and whatnot. She’s not breathing … bring a body-bag or whatever you do. I’m 99.9% sure she’s not breathing.”  The teenager told police they felt “strange” and was on “auto-pilot” at the time of the attack.  Dr Basil Purdue, a pathologist, concluded that although Ms Thompson was unconscious, her heart was still beating when Rowan stabbed her 118 times.  Dr John Sandford, a psychiatrist, said Rowan had minor autism but added there was nothing to suggest the teenager was suffering from “abnormal mental functioning”.  But Mr Thompson claimed two other psychiatrists had “opposing views” and believed the teenager was “mentally incapacitated”.  The coroner, Jason Pegg, recorded a verdict of unlawful killing. Rowan’s inquest is due to take place in Manchester next year.   

F  or more than two centuries the seaside town of Tenby in south-west  Wales  has gladly welcomed tourists to its sandy beaches, picturesque harbour and cobbled streets, but the imminent arrival of the crowds this July is provoking a mix of emotions. 
Many of those whose livelihoods depend on the tourism industry cannot wait for the first visitors to arrive on Monday when Wales’ stay-local travel restrictions are lifted, but others, including vulnerable people, are worried the incomers will bring Covid-19 to a corner of Britain that has largely escaped the virus.

“I don’t want the tourists here,” said Gavin Johnson, “The time isn’t right yet. We’ve been sensible and don’t have many cases. I don’t know anyone who has had Covid. We don’t want that thrown away.” 
Johnson was sitting on a bench in the town centre with his wife, Emma, who uses a wheelchair and has been shielding since March. “This is the first time since lockdown I’ve been out of the house,” she said. “It feels great.” But come Monday, Emma will be back indoors. 
The Johnsons were chatting – at a 2-metre distance – with their friend Wendy James. Though she works in tourism, James does not relish the return of visitors to the town. “I don’t have faith that everyone is still taking Covid seriously,” she said. “This disease is not going to stop overnight. It’s still here with us. It’s scary.” 
Friends Lisa Jenkins and Hayley Clark had taken their children to one of Tenby’s sandy beaches for the final time before the tourists arrive.

They too have been shielding and their trips out have been carefully planned and controlled. “It gets rammed here in the summer,” said Jenkins. “We won’t be coming back.” Clark fears the arrival of thousands of visitors will lead to a spike in the number of cases in the autumn. “Nobody has had it here so the worry is that it will be our turn for it to take off,” she said. 
Wales’ lockdown, which has been stricter than England’s, means that Tenby’s beaches – unlike, say, those of  Bournemouth  - have been pretty much deserted this summer. 
From Monday, however, people will be able to legally travel from far and wide to resorts like Tenby when the Welsh government lifts its instruction for people to remain local. 
The first to arrive are expected to be day-trippers and second home-owners. Then, if the number of Covid-19 cases continues to fall in Wales, the Labour-led government is due to give the go-ahead for visitors to head to self-contained accommodation from next Saturday (11 July).

Michael Williams, who represents Tenby North on Pembrokeshire county council and leads the Plaid Cymru group, said the town was in a tricky position. 
“We can’t survive without tourism. But on the other hand, there is huge trepidation, if not fear, about the influx we are going to see. Usually the Tenby population is 5,500. In the summer, it rises to 60,000. The change is going to be very rapid.” 
Williams said a “surprising” number of second home-owners had already defied the stay-local travel restriction and visited Tenby, leading to tension.

“There have been exchanges in the town between local people and those that have come in. It’s been quite unpleasant at time. Locals have been advising people not very gently to go home. Tenby’s not that type of community. It emphasises the fear there is.” 
The Morris Brothers store (est 1866) sells everything the visitor might need for a beach trip, from sun hats and fishing rods to windbreaks and waterproofs. 
Alex Gourlay, who has worked in the shop for almost 50 years, said the whole town needed tourism. “Without it everybody is in trouble,” he said. “Not just the hotels, B_Bs and cafes but the builders, the plumbers, everyone. It’s all connected.” 
He expects tourists to come in huge numbers. “People have been locked down. They’re fed up. Loads of people are going to come down – and possibly some will bring the virus with them.” 
As of 1 July there had been 229 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Pembrokeshire per 100,000 people, one of the lowest rates in Wales. The figure for Cardiff is 617 and for the south Wales valleys town of Merthyr Tydfil it is 897. 
Retired boatman David Crockford, 84, was enjoying a coffee at the harbour snack bar. “I’m apprehensive,” he said. “We’ve been safe down here, more or less, and that’s going to change. By the law of averages, tourists are bound to bring Covid-19 in. But local people are suffering financially. They need the visitors.” 
Sarah Jones, a carer, agreed. She, her family and friends have been enjoying having miles of sandy beach to themselves. “The weather has been great – like Barbados. We don’t really want people to bring Covid but now’s the time to take the risk. We’ve got to get on with it and take the risk. Tourism is what this town does.” 

A supermarket worker killed his wife and teenage daughter in a jealous rage after “losing his controlling influence” over their lives, a jury has been told.  Marcin Zdun attacked Aneta Zdun, a 40-year-old carer who worked with vulnerable people, and their daughter Nikoleta Zdun, 18, after his wife ordered him to leave home and said she wanted a divorce, the court heard.    The women were found critically injured at their home in Salisbury on 1 June. When Zdun, a Polish national, was arrested at the scene of the killings, police found a folding lock knife in his trouser pocket with blood stains on the blade and handle, it is alleged.  Zdun, 40,  admits killing the women but denies murder , claiming he has no recollection of what happened and had an “abnormality of mental functioning”.  Opening the trial at Winchester crown court, Nicholas Haggan QC, prosecuting, said around a month before the women were killed, the defendant had tried to strangle his wife. The court was told Nikoleta wanted to call the police but her mother convinced her not to dial 999, insisting she was fine.  But Zdun was subsequently asked to leave the family home and his wife sought a divorce. She told her mother that she was worried Zdun might kill her and her daughter.  Zdun told a number of people that his wife was having an affair with a man he worked with at Tesco, but this was a “manifestation of the defendant’s jealous suspicions” as they had never even met, Haggan said.  The prosecutor told the jury: “We suggest the loss of his controlling influence over Aneta and Nikoleta so angered this defendant that … he decided to kill them.”  Haggan said there was evidence that pointed to the defendant having a “controlling nature”, and he complained that his wife was spending too much money and giving their daughter anything she wanted.  The prosecutor said 1 June was a “special date” in the Polish calendar. He said: “It is known as Children’s Day. It is an occasion when families celebrate and it is traditional for parents to give presents to their children.  “At some point during the early afternoon of Monday 1 June 2020, the defendant left his lodgings and walked the 2.6 miles or so to the family home.”  He said neighbours heard screaming. “Several people went to investigate. As they looked through a wire mesh fence into the garden, they were confronted by a horrific spectacle. They saw the defendant use a knife to attack Aneta and Nikoleta in a pathway running along the side of the property.”  The trial continues.   

B  en Waugh, who runs a bicycle hire shop on the seafront at  Bournemouth , has lived in the seaside resort all his life but has never seen so many people packed on to the beach – and so much terrible behaviour. 
“I understand why people wanted to come,” he said, as the cleanup continued around him. “It’s the best beach around and when the weather’s good it’s like being in Benidorm. But what happened here this week was horrific.” 
Waugh watched aghast as groups of revellers took drugs and drank their way through countless crates of beer. “There was a Lord of the Flies vibe to it. The atmosphere was ugly.” 
John White, a retired carer, said he had seen the chaos coming as the temperature soared and, rather than take his normal stroll on the beach, had headed inland to the New Forest. 
“People were camping on the cliffs and the beaches. There were mobile homes everywhere. There are only a few toilets. I dread to think what the back of the beach huts is like. Shameful.” 
A  major incident was declared  on Thursday after up to half a million people flocked to the sandy Dorset beaches. 
Coronavirus UK: are cases rising or falling near you?

White is concerned that the invasion could lead to an increase in coronavirus infections. “Elderly people stayed away – they are too sensible to go near. But you wonder if this will lead to a rise in covid. We haven’t got this right at all. Next time we get a hot day they should close the access roads. Simple as that.” 
Council workers and volunteers worked on Thursday night and Friday morning to clear the beach of many tonnes of rubbish. It was not only wrappers, bottles and barbecues that were left, though there were plenty of them. Unlucky crews had to deal with human faeces left in a box on the beach and discarded underwear. 
Peter Ryan, the founder of Dorset Devils, a litter-picking group who took part in the cleanup, said the beach was left in the worst state he had ever seen it.

“The sights and smell were horrendous, like nothing I’ve ever come across before. There was the smell of weed, urine and excrement, and we found so many empty beer bottles. There were cans, wrappers, wet wipes and even underpants. It was horrific.” 
On Friday it was much less busy. A few stragglers had camped on the beach, amid the gorse on the clifftops. Someone had bedded down on a crazy golf course. 
The most serious incident happened on Thursday evening when   three men, all in their 20s and from London,  were stabbed  during a fight near the amusements on Bournemouth pier. 
Vikki Slade, the Lib Dem leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council, described the day as “chaos” and a “breakdown in public behaviour”. 
She said she had been calling for months for people in England to be ordered to stay within their own county or within a certain postcode area near their home, rather than being allowed to drive across the country. 
Graphic 
Slade said the council did not have the power to close the beaches but said the government should devolve such powers to local police forces when needed. “Otherwise, how do you get hundreds of thousands of people off the beach? Guidelines are useless. You need laws and powers.” 
She said there was a funding issue, too. “Small counties like Dorset with a small and poorly funded police force and two councils that have had huge funding gaps simply don’t have the resources to deal with visitors who are behaving as though it’s a festival when they are not paying for the privilege.”

Downing Street insisted the issue of overcrowded beaches was not one for ministers, who would only act if there were indications of a rise in Covid-19 infection rates. 

Mike Croker, a retired police officer born and bred on Cornwall’s rugged Atlantic coast, had donned his Cornish tartan tie to greet the first tourists of the summer.  “It’s good to see the visitors back in the town,” said Croker, 72. “They’ve been missed and they are very welcome. This place needs tourism to survive.”    But he was also concerned. “Of course, we’re worried they may bring Covid. We’ve seen  the crowds at Bournemouth beach ,  in Liverpool after their football team won the league , and at the  Black Lives Matter  demonstrations.  “We’ve had hardly any coronavirus down here. People have, by and large, been sensible and observed the restrictions. We hope visitors will do the same.”  Under the latest  easing of lockdown restrictions in England , people can stay away from home for the first time this summer, effectively signalling the start of the season for resorts across the country.  From dawn on Saturday, a stream of vehicles towing caravans, camper vans and cars loaded with surfboards, kayaks and bicycles headed south-west.

Cornwall council and Visit Cornwall estimated that between 70,000 and 80,000 holidaymakers arrived in the county over the weekend.  Rob Barber, the owner of Newquay Activity Centre  on Towan beach,  breathed a sigh of relief. “It’s great to be open again,” he said. “We’ve had guests from Birmingham and London here this weekend. It feels pretty much like a normal July.”  The reopening has come just in time for many businesses in Newquay, but a lot of work lies ahead. “We’ve got eight weeks to do the business we normally do in three or four months,” said Barber. 
Coronavirus UK: are Covid-19 cases rising or falling near you?  
Read more        About 100 people filed into the town’s Blue Reef Aquarium on the first day of the season. This was about half the normal crowd for this time of year.  Steve Matchett, general manager, said the reopening had been desperately needed. “We’ve lost four months of key revenue,” he said. “We didn’t qualify for the government assistance schemes. Reopening was vital for us.”  On the face of it, life on the beach seemed normal. But there were countless tiny changes. The Beach Bakery asked customers to read a list of a dozen guidelines, , which covered queuing, ordering and hand sanitising, before buying a pasty.  A notice on the deckchair hut assured users that its equipment had been disinfected. The amusement arcade spelled out that only members of the same household were allowed to play the cuddly toy grab game together.  In recent years Newquay has become known as a party town, as well as one of the UK’s surf capitals. Before the lockdown easing, Devon and Cornwall police were given a  £500,000 “fighting fund”  to bolster its response in 20 locations including Newquay. Over the weekend it put into place the sort of operation usually only launched on New Year’s Eve.  Pubs, bars and restaurants did their bit, arranging one-way systems and imposing reduced capacities. Customers were asked to order drinks via apps and contact details were taken for contact tracing.  By mid-afternoon, the police had been called into action, having to firmly escort one person out of a pub. Later, as darkness fell, there were reports of disorder and drink-related antisocial behaviour across the force area, not only in Newquay but across the county border in Torquay, Barnstaple and Teignmouth.

Roy Coombes, a 73-year-old local, went on a mini pub crawl of Newquay, including a golf club bar, the Red Lion, a rowing club bar and Wetherspoons, to have a few pints and see how things were working out. “By and large people seemed to be acting responsibly,” he said. “We can’t stop people coming now that the prime minister has opened the door and said you can come.”  Cornwall council has to tread a delicate line between supporting the hospitality industry and flagging up concerns about a second Covid-19 spike. Councillor Tim Dwelly, the portfolio holder for culture, economy and planning, said businesses had worked hard to make their premises safe and he called for visitors to do their bit by planning trips carefully and trying to spread out as much as possible.

Terms and conditions          “Explore the quieter parts and have a great holiday. It’s really important that visitors do everything they can to maximise distances from other people,” he said.   What the tourism industry really fears is a second lockdown in the autumn. “That would be a disaster,” Dwelly added.  As the crowds headed to Cornwall, an image did the rounds on Twitter purporting to show three people standing on a bridge over the A30 holding a sign that read “Turn around and fuck off”.

In Newquay, most people accepted it wasn’t as simple as that. Steve Ingham, who does odd jobs on Towan beach, said he was worried there would be a spike of cases in Cornwall. “If the good weather comes, it will be chocka down here and we’ll be back in lockdown by the end of the summer. But what can you do? We’ve got to take the money where we can.”   

On the promenade at Durley Chine in  Bournemouth  there’s a gaping hole where Stuart Smith’s family beach hut used to stand.  After 13 years on the waiting list, and almost a decade of enjoying summers on the beach from the comfort of their 7ft by 5ft (2.13 metres to 1.5 metres) bottle green cabin, the family have finally been forced to give up their spot to make way for a £2.4m environmental innovation hub the council are building on the site.    “It’s just a shed in the garden now, it’s just memories,” said Smith, whose family have recently paid £2,000 to have the hut upgraded. “It’s the end of an era, we’ve had it for the children, family get-togethers, meeting friends; it’s sad.”

Read more        All 11 privately owned beach huts on this stretch have to be removed by the end of August, to make way for the new educational facility designed to teach visitors about the dangers of plastic waste.  Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) council have staunchly defended their actions, with council leader, Vikki Slade, saying during a livestreamed Q_A session on Wednesday: “If you have a beach hut you have no right to that beach hut for ever, it’s an annual tenancy.”  
People enjoy the hot weather on Durley and Alum Chine beaches, 25 May.  Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA   For Slade, the benefits of the new development far outweigh the loss of the huts. “We’re providing a new facility for thousands and thousands of people, a new attraction for the seafront that everyone will benefit from, and unfortunately 11 people won’t have a beach hut.”  She said it was unfair to give the hut owners priority over the next people on the waiting list for a spot, but this was dismissed by Smith. “We waited 13 years on that list and now we’ve had it taken away from us. Yes, it’s a privilege, but we’ve been paying for that privilege,” he said.  The Smith family hut is one of the first to go. They paid £250 to have it dismantled and relocated to Smith’s father-in-law’s garden, a sad loss for the family who described it as their “safe haven”.  “My wife and son have type one diabetes, my father-in-law has immune system problems, I have heart problems, so we used this as a safe getaway. We can’t be sat where there’s masses and masses of people,” said Smith. His children, 13-year-old Hayden and 11-year-old Maisie, often used the hut with their friends, and the family offered it up to the local Scout group for activities on the beach.  “They’ve basically just brushed us off. It feels like the council just do what they want to do, they don’t listen to the electorate,” said Smith. “Who’s going to use [the hub]? People come to the beach to sunbathe and have fun, they don’t go to the beach to go to some eco-centre to find out about plastic recycling.”  
The Smith family described the hut as their ‘safe haven’.  Photograph: Martin Godwin/The Guardian   BCP council said it notified hut owners of the need to vacate in March, giving them plenty of time to make alternative arrangements, but Smith said the lockdown has meant they’ve had little time to make plans.  The hut owners have also been offered the option of moving to council-owned huts on Bournemouth West less than a mile away, but Smith said the annual cost would be £3,000 a year, almost twice what they currently pay to rent their spot.  Slade said she was looking into this claim, but if the new site is in a more “premium location” this would be understandable. A BCP council spokesperson said they were talking directly with tenants about the options available, and “trying to ensure a fair solution for those looking to take an alternative option”.  The council has also offered to pay owners £250 to buy their hut if they no longer want it, but Smith said his family had just spent £2,000 for a new hut. “It’s just not viable, none of these offers are reasonable at all,” he said.  Smith said he suggested an alternative site for the huts nearby on Middle Chine beach but after his proposal was declined, he decided to set up an  online petition  and push for the council to reverse its decision.  “The council can’t keep treating locals like this,” he said. “They were elected by the people and they need to start treating the people correctly.”

Five thousand people stood on the pitch of Bradford City football ground yesterday in a public display of their private grief for the victims of the  Bradford fire disaster .  It was never going to be an ordinary memorial service. Even the venue, the ground itself, was thought by some not to be appropriate, still less a cross of charred timber being erected.    People began arriving nearly an hour before the open-air, multi-denominational service began to see a podium decked with flowers in front of the remains of the stand.  Flowers were laid out along the charred remains of the seats with football scarves, photographs and a small teddy bear left by the only remaining son of one family. A card read: ‘The day tragedy belittled a dream, awaited for three generations.’

Photograph: Jim Duxbury/ANL/REX Shutterstock   Relatives of the 56 people who have lost their lives were lost in the crowd, returning for the first time to the ground. Among them was Mrs Susan Fletcher, whose husband, a son, and father-in-law died in the blaze. She sat with her 12-year-old son  Martin  who survived.  In front of the main podium was a floral display depicting a footballer in Bradford’s colours. As the service began, the players of  Bradford  and Lincoln led a procession of supporters, policemen, firemen, ambulancemen, nurses, dignitaries and clergy, into the ground.  They walked past the row of seats where the blaze began, now marked by only four flowers placed by relatives. Hardly anyone looked at the stark remains of the stand.  School children sat for a while in the gutted stand and then, walked forward and fixed 56 posies to the main podium, remembering those who perished. Other children later walked through the congregation handing out single carnations.

Soaring temperatures across the UK will be followed by thunderstorms and torrential rain over coming days, forecasters have warned.  Wednesday  was the hottest day of the year so far  but the Met Office said Thursday could beat that record, with temperatures expected to climb in the Midlands and Wales.    However, thunderstorms are expected to form across the west of the UK in the afternoon, bringing heavy rain, lighting and hail.  
Quick Guide  How global heating is causing more extreme weather         Show   
Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system._  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “ could not have occurred without human-induced climate change ”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was  made at least 50 times more likely by global heating , linking it directly to climate change.  Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding._  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is  strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves  (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.  When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California._  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons.  Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique _last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made  three times more likely by climate change . Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.  Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely.  Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies  and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the  ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK , it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.

Thank you for your feedback.      West London is forecast to see temperatures peak between 32C and 33C, while parts of  Wales  could see the mercury rise to 34C.  Should that happen, it would be the hottest June on record in Wales, surpassing the previous peak of 33.7C on 18 June 2000.  Met Office meteorologist John Griffiths said the Midlands could see temperatures reach 32C on Thursday, while the Welsh Marches – the area along the Welsh border – could see temperatures of 34C “very locally”.  The hot weather is expected to turn from 4pm on Thursday as thunderstorms form in the south-west and south-east of England, Wales, western Scotland and Northern Ireland.  The Met Office has issued a yellow weather alert for those areas until 9am on Friday, warning of disruption due to flooding, lightning strikes, hail and wind. Between 30mm to 40mm of rain could fall in less than two hours.  The storms are expected to continue from midday on Friday through to 6am on Saturday, with another yellow warning in place for the whole of the UK.  Areas hit by the storms could experience “torrential downpours” with 30-50mm of rain falling in an hour.  On Wednesday the mercury peaked at 32.6C at London’s Heathrow airport at 2.46pm.  The hot weather saw people flock to beaches in huge numbers despite social distancing measures remaining in place.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA   The Met Office raised its heat alert level to three, as health authorities encouraged those most vulnerable – many of whom have been shielding during lockdown – to protect themselves amid the “exceptionally hot weather forecast this week”.  Public  Health  England (PHE) said older people, those with underlying health conditions, and very young children were all more at risk from the higher temperatures.  The amber level three, which remains in place for the east and West Midlands, requires social and healthcare services to target specific actions at high-risk groups, according to the Met Office website.  People have been advised to keep cool and stay hydrated where possible.  The Met Office said UV levels were expected to remain at eight across many parts of the UK on Thursday.  
People cool off in the water and sunbathe on the riverbank at Hackney Marshes in east London.  Photograph: Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images   Dr Michaela Hegglin, associate professor in atmospheric chemistry at the University of Reading’s department of meteorology, said Thursday could see some of the “highest UV levels ever recorded” in Britain.  She said: “This is because of a combination of factors. We are at the summer solstice, when the sun is almost directly overhead at one o’clock.  “UV levels this high are rare in the UK, so people with light skin should be very careful to avoid getting burnt. While UV is important for getting vitamin D and keeping us healthy, too much of it can cause skin cancer or eye cataracts.”  Emer O’Connell, consultant in public health at PHE, said it was important that people kept checking on the vulnerable, as many continued to spend more time at home due to coronavirus.  Shoppers have also been advised to be aware they could be forced to spend extra time in the sun as a result of social distancing measures. And dog owners have been urged to avoid exercising their pets during the hottest part of the day.  The public is also being reminded to take care around water throughout the summer, amid concerns people might be tempted to take a dip to cool down. Thames Valley police said on Wednesday officers had found a body, following a search for a missing man who is believed to have got into difficulty in the water at Lulle Brook in Cookham, Berkshire, on Tuesday.   

The coronavirus pandemic has sunk plans to plans to retrieve and exhibit the Titanic’s radio equipment, according to a court filing made by the firm that own’s the historic wreck’s salvage rights.  RMS Titanic Inc cited the “increasing difficulty associated with international travel and logistics, and the associated health risks to the expedition team”. It also it had to lay off high-profile experts in the Titanic field: Dave Gallo, PH Nargeolet, Bill Sauder and William Lange.    The Atlanta-based company also said that it’s gone nearly a year without its primary source of revenue after virus restrictions closed exhibits of its vast collection of Titanic artifacts. Only some of the exhibitions, which are scattered across the country, have reopened. But they’re seeing limited attendance.  The company, however, maintained that it’s financially secure. The firm said the radio expedition remains a top priority and will “take place as soon as reasonably practicable”.  The company has argued that exhibiting the radio will help sustain the ship’s legacy while honoring passengers and crew. Known in 1912 as a Marconi wireless telegraph machine, the radio sent distress calls to nearby ships that helped save 700 people in lifeboats.  But even without the pandemic, the expedition has been far from guaranteed. The firm has been in an ongoing court battle with the US government over whether the undertaking is legal.  Lawyers for the US government have argued that the mission is barred under federal law and an international agreement with Britain. The attorneys say the company must seek the government’s permission to remove the radio because the sunken vessel is a recognized memorial to the roughly 1,500 people who died.  The luxury ocean liner was traveling from England to New York in 1912 when it struck an iceberg and sank. It was discovered in 1985 about 2.4 miles (3.8km) below the surface of the North Atlantic.   

Hampshire police officers were recorded on a hidden bug making racist, sexist and homophobic comments and wishing death on foreigners, a disciplinary hearing has heard.  The officers, part of a specialist police unit that was described as “plain nasty”, were overheard insulting communities they were sworn to serve, the tribunal in Winchester heard.    An anonymous complaint had led to electronic bugs being placed in their offices between 9 March and 2 April 2018.  Six current and former officers from Hampshire police’s serious and organised crime unit (Socu) office in Basingstoke are accused of breaching professional standards and face a three-week tribunal.  The officers are DS Oliver Lage, former PC Craig Bannerman, trainee detective constable Andrew Ferguson, and PC James Oldfield. In addition, retired DI Tim Ireson and DS Gregory Willcox are accused of failing to fulfil their supervisory roles to stop or report the inappropriate behaviour.  Opening the case against them, Jason Beer QC said: “It was a unit that was racist – a black officer is described as a ‘pavement special’, ie a mixed-breed dog. People are described as ‘pikeys’; a black officer is accused of behaving like a colonial overseer running a plantation of white people. When speaking to a black officer, a colleague puts on a fake Caribbean accent – in fact he was from Ghana. A detail like that doesn’t matter, he was a black man after all.  “A black officer is accused of being flown to England from Africa in a crate and taken to London zoo; all the time a song is sung in the background to the tune of Buffalo Soldier.”  Beer added that “offensive” photos of black men were shared on a WhatsApp group in reference to the only black officer in the unit.  Beer also said the unit displayed sexism: “Women were called or referred to as ‘whores’, ‘sluts’, ‘sweet tits’ or ‘sugar tits’, ‘Dorises’, ‘a fucking Doris’ … A suspect is called a ‘fucking cunt’. And the officers ponder amongst themselves if a person using the tannoy system is ‘getting any cock’.”  Beer said the covert recording device caught derogatory terms being used for disabled, gay and transgender people, and suggestions that Albanian nationals “should be shot or even killed with a nerve agent”.  It was also said that “illegal immigrants deserve the death penalty”, Beer told the hearing. “The officers joked about immigrants having a ‘long swim’ and drowning in the sea.”  He added: “It was a unit that was plain nasty, that displayed attitudes towards groups and communities that police officers are called upon to protect.”  Beer said the unit enjoyed relative isolation from the rest of the force due to the sensitive and sometimes covert nature of its work.  “That isolation and a lack of leadership by Mr Ireson and DS Willcox appears to have led to a toxic, abhorrent culture developing in the unit amongst some officers,” he said. “[This] is inconsistent with the values and standards of the police service in the 21st century and inconsistent with continued service in the police service.”  Beer said the investigation into the unit also examined texts and emails, which uncovered similar material.  Oldfield is also accused of attending work after excessive drinking, and DS Willcox is also alleged to have falsely recorded hours and overtime, according to Hampshire police.  All the officers deny gross misconduct. The hearing continues.   

Police have charged two men in connection with the alleged hijacking of a tanker off the coast of the Isle of Wight in October.  Matthew John Okorie, 25, and Sunday Sylvester, 22, appeared in court on Saturday charged with an offence relating to conduct endangering ships, Hampshire constabulary said.    The charges come as part of the ongoing investigation into the 25 October incident, when stowaways boarded the Nave Andromeda vessel in a suspected hijacking, but were stopped by a British Special Boat Service (SBS) raid backed by airborne snipers.  Seven Nigerian men were detained by the SBS, and they remain on police bail while investigations continue.  The raid was authorised by the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, and the home secretary, Priti Patel, after a tense 10-hour standoff.  The 748ft (228m) Nave Andromeda had been heading towards Southampton, having set sail from Lagos in Nigeria. The ship’s operator, Navios Tankers Management, said the stowaways illegally boarded the Liberian-flagged tanker in Lagos.  Okorie and Sylvester will remain in custody until they appear at Southampton crown court on 29 January.  The five other men arrested on suspicion of seizing or exercising control of a ship by use of threats or force remain on police bail until 25 January.   

British airlines and airports have been told they will not receive an industry-wide bailout, despite an initial  pledge of support  from the chancellor last week.  The news emerged as the International Air Transport Association (Iata) called for urgent government assistance and warned that airlines would lose $252bn (£215bn) in revenues in 2020 – more than double its  “worst-case” forecast two weeks ago .   
Coronavirus travel updates: which countries have restrictions and FCO warnings in place?  
Read more        UK-based airports – which are still operating cargo flights and repatriation services – warned they may have to shut down temporarily following the Treasury’s decision on Tuesday afternoon.  The chancellor,  Rishi Sunak , wrote to airline and airport executives on Tuesday reiterating the measures he announced on Friday to support jobs and industry across all sectors, including paying the bulk of staff wages and deferring some rates and tax payments.  His letter said that “as a last resort” there could be discussions with individual firms after those measures had been taken into account – but made clear that, for now, he does not share the  aviation industry’s view  that it is a special case.  The government’s view of the sector is understood to have been hardened by the decision of airlines including  easyJet  to continue with planned dividend payments to shareholders. EasyJet said it had a legal obligation to proceed with a £171m payout, which will give the largest shareholder, Stelios Haji-Ioannou, another £60m windfall. 
A few points to ponder before beginning a bailout of airlines | Nils Pratley  
Read more        Sunak warned that “taxpayer support would only be possible if all commercial avenues have been fully explored, including raising further capital from existing investors”.  He also said the government would have to consider “equitable and fair treatment of businesses across the [aviation] sector”, a factor that could scupper any negotiations or bailouts for specific airlines. British Airways owner IAG has already distanced itself from rivals’ calls for assistance, and filed complaints in January when it appeared that Flybe – the first airline to go bust since the coronavirus outbreak –  could get state aid .  EasyJet said it was reviewing the chancellor’s letter and measures announced last week for businesses. A spokeswoman said: “Our immediate focus is on liquidity and protecting jobs and we are working with the government to make best use of these measures.”  Airports were surprised by the decision. The chief executive of the Airport Operators Association, Karen Dee, said: “After [the government] publicly announced a support package for airports and airlines, we’re surprised by where we find ourselves today.”  Scheduled passenger traffic is virtually gone from many airports, with even Heathrow mainly seeing repatriation flights and cargo services. 
Some travel firms and airlines refusing to issue refunds – Which?  
Read more        Dee said airports were taking unprecedented steps to safeguard staff and operations through the crisis, and some were considering shutting down for a period. However, some were still providing “lifeline services” for remote communities and to ensure freight and vital medical supplies arrived in the UK.  She added: “While countries across Europe have recognised the vital role airports play and are stepping into the breach, the UK government’s decision to take a case-by-case approach with dozens of UK airports is simply not feasible to provide the support necessary in the coming days.”  Airports have urged the deferral of other taxes, and the easing of regulatory costs and constraints, while global flight restrictions continue.

Terms and conditions          Meanwhile, the global airlines body, Iata, said European airlines were the most likely to collapse first, following earlier warnings that most carriers worldwide would be bankrupt by May. Countries that cover 98% of commercial air passenger revenues now have restricted travel, with airlines announcing mass-groundings of their fleets.  Iata’s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, called for government aid to airlines “with maximum speed”.  He added: “We are working hard to survive … we need governments to bridge the gap.” Iata said that revenues would be down 44% on last year.

Matt Hancock  also confirmed that households in the areas of the north of England affected by the additional lockdown measure cannot visit each other at home – but they can visit households outside the affected areas as long as they observe social distancing. 
He told BBC Breakfast: “Strictly, the law that we’re bringing in is that two households cannot meet in the area defined but obviously any two households should follow the social distancing rules.”

Lockdown measures not done with Eid in mind - Hancock 
The UK health secretary has denied that the additional lockdown measures in the north of England were introduced with this evening’s celebrations of the Muslim festival of  Eid  in mind. 
“My heart goes out to the Muslim communities in these areas because I know how important the Eid celebrations are. I am very grateful to the local Muslim leaders, the imams, who have been working so hard across the country to have Covid-secure celebrations,” he told the Today programme. 
He also told the BBC: “Unfortunately this change does mean that people won’t be able to get together in their houses, in their gardens. 
“But we are allowing mosques and other religious places to stay open because they’ve done so much work to allow for Covid-secure celebration and worship.” 
Questioned about the rules, Hancock said parks and outdoor public spaces were the safest place. Asked why people could not have guests from other households in their gardens, but could go to the pub, he said the “guidance for hospitality” is to only go with your own household. 
But people would end up mixing with others at the pub?  
“No, because the way pubs have managed to do that is to do that in a socially distanced way from other households,” he replied. 
The decision to implement the additional lockdown measures in the north of England was taken “as soon as was practically possible”, according to Hancock, responding to questions about why it as announced in a tweet with three hours before them came into effect.  
It was also clear from data that the spread of the virus was happening in households between people visiting each other, much more than among people in work, and that was why the measures were taken.

A “functioning” test and trace system is what is really needed in place of the additional lockdown measures in the north of England, according to one expert who has been a high-profile commentator during the pandemic and who is sceptical of the actions taken by the government in the north of England 
Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence-based medicine at the University of Oxford, has told the BBC’s Today programme that the alarm needs to be sounded because of concerns about care homes.  
“If you really want to do a great job in reducing excess deaths then you need a plan that focuses on the old and the very vulnerable and I just don’t see that plan now,” he said.

Police are ready to set up roadblocks, create diversions and  close off sections of Bournemouth beach  to prevent a repeat of last month’s chaotic scenes as a heatwave sweeps parts of the UK. 
With temperatures forecast to hit 33C in parts of southern England, some officers have been asked to work extended shifts and weekend leave has been cancelled for others as the emergency services and the local council brace themselves for another major influx of visitors. 
Supt Richard Bell, of Dorset police, said plans had been put in place to cope with another possible surge. But Bell said: “We are definitely not asking people to stay away. We welcome all visitors, but ask them to respect the environment and the community.”

With the weather being very hot the next couple of days, we are expecting it to be busy down the beaches, but we don't want a repeat of the parking issues we had previously.  Please be considerate and only park in legal spaces, do not park on pavements, double yellows or zigzags.  _  
July 30, 2020 
Bell said the force did not expect the beaches to be as crowded this time because hotels, campsites, pubs and restaurants are open. In June, the beach was one of the few places people could go to. 
A plan is also in place for Lulworth Cove in Dorset,  another spot that has attracted crowds this summer . Bell said a one-way system used when the Camp Bestival was being staged would swing into operation if it got too busy.

The mayor of  Greater Manchester ,  Andy Burnham , has said the government was right to take action in the north of England after it became clear that the picture on Covid-19 cases had changed. 
He told Sky News:  
On the substance, we do accept that these steps are needed. They’re modest steps. We’re asking people not to have visitors at home, if they go to the pub to stick within their own household - steps that hopefully will prevent much more severe restrictions if we take firm action at this time. 
And the reason for it is the picture changed in Greater Manchester over the last week. We’re watching the data very, very closely, like the government is. 
At the same time, the government has been taking flak from its own ranks

Some Conservatives in Greater Manchester not happy at all with govt’s decision to impose new lockdown restrictions on the entire region.   One Tory MP in GM texts: “This is ridiculous. It’s Oldham and Rochdale. To place this on the whole of GM is a nonsense.”

There has been confusion about how widely the new restrictions applied in parts of northern England and the handling of the announcement was criticised by both Labour and Conservative MPs. 
The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said announcing the lockdown measures “ late at night on Twitter ” was “a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis”. 
He added: “When the government ended the daily press conferences, they said they would hold them for ‘significant announcements’, including local lockdowns. It’s hard to imagine what could be more significant than this. 
Keir Starmer

No one would argue with putting in place local action to reduce the transmission of coronavirus.  But announcing measures affecting potentially millions of people late at night on Twitter is a new low for the government’s communications during this crisis.

In 13 of the 19 local authority areas affected, the rate of Covid-19 in the seven days to 27 July has gone up, with 1,536 cases recorded across all the areas in the space of a week.

Parts of Northern England wake up to new lockdown measures 
Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live blog coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK,  where large swathes of northern England have been waking up this morning  to additional lockdown restrictions are to be imposed over large swathes of northern England. 
The measures, announced on Thursday evening and put in place from midnight, come after what Health Secretary  Matt Hancock  said had been a a surge of coronavirus cases caused largely by people “not abiding to social distancing”, 
Hancock announced that people from different households in   Greater Manchester , parts of East Lancashire, West Yorkshire and Leicester  would not be able to meet each other indoors.  
It is the first time further lockdown measures have been applied to such a large geographic area, covering millions of homes, and comes on the eve of Eid al-Adha celebrations, which would have been held in many of the cities and towns affected. 
Also on our radar today is an  Office for National Statistics  (ONS)  weekly update of figures on coronavirus and social impacts  (9.30pm). It comes after data analysis released by the ONS revealed that England   had the highest levels of excess deaths in  Europe  in the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic. 
There’s also a briefing by  the grouping of experts who have set themselves up as an independent ‘mirror’  to the government’s official Sage advisory panel ( 11.30pm ) 
The  Independent Sage committee  – a body of 12 scientists and experts set up in parallel to the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) – is chaired by the former UK government chief scientific adviser Sir  David King , who has criticised the official body’s previous lack of transparency.

Briefings to newspapers have led to more people flouting the Government’s Covid-19 lockdown rules, the shadow health secretary  Jonathan Ashworth  has said.     
The Leicester South Labour MP blamed headlines suggesting an easing of restrictions from Monday on several national titles’ front pages on Thursday, which were all based on briefings, for the apparent confusion in the population about the next phase of the lockdown. 
Police forces voiced frustration as people flocked to parks and were socialising outdoors on Friday and Saturday. 
Speaking to Sky News’ Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ashworth said: “The frustration is that we had different briefings to different newspapers throughout the week.   
“I think some of those briefings to newspapers has led to the situation yesterday and on Friday of lots of people going to parks, enjoying the sunshine.   
“We have seen an increase in road traffic and I think we have seen more Coastguard call-outs than at any other point during the lockdown.   
“This lockdown, which we have been in now for seven weeks, has contributed to hospital admissions falling and the death rate falling, and you’d hope and expect that, and that is a tribute to the British public who have followed the stay home advice.”  
At the daily Downing Street press conference on Saturday, transport secretary  Grant Shapps  warned that the government would proceed with “extreme caution” when lifting lockdown measures.

The prime minister risks jeopardising the successes of the coronavirus lockdown in dropping his “stay home” slogan, a scientist advising the government has said. 
Behavioural expert Prof Susan Michie, who is a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said Johnson’s new messaging was “a long way” from being clear and consistent and could give people the green light to socialise.   
It comes after all devolved nations rejected the new slogan, with Wales and  Scotland  saying they weren’t consulted on the change.

Leaders of all the devolved nations have now rejected Boris Johnson’s new “stay alert” slogan, and have vowed to continue with the existing “stay at home” message. 
Instead of the original advice, the prime minister is now telling the public to “stay at home as much as possible”, to keep two metres apart when going out and “limit contact” with other people.  
Despite the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, saying the government’s “strong preference” was for a UK-wide response, all devolved nations have rejected the new slogan.  
Health ministers in Wales and Scotland, as well as the Scottish first minister,  Nicola Sturgeon , have said they were not consulted about the change of message and found out about it through media reports.

Health professionals have issued a new legal challenge demanding an  urgent inquiry into the government’s failure to provide PPE  for frontline workers.  
A pre-action letter sent by the Doctor’s Association UK (DA) and the Good Law Project (GLP), which are responsible for bringing the challenge, provides a list of “recurrent and systemic” failures in PPE supplies.  
The groups are demanding legal action be taken immediately so that “lessons can be learnt” in case of a resurgence in the virus.  
“It is a tragedy that nearly 200 healthcare workers in the UK have died due to Covid-19,” said a spokesperson for the DA. “There has been recurrent and systemic failure of the PPE supply chain, leaving staff in some instances with makeshift or no PPE. 
“Every healthcare worker death from Covid-19 must be investigated, the issue of PPE has to be considered as part of that. Until we establish all the factors involved we feel that inquests must be opened,” they added.  
“With the Good Law Project, we are seeking a legal remedy by compelling the secretary of state for health and social care to discharge his statutory duty to promptly and properly order an investigation of healthcare worker deaths.”

“We can control the virus by keeping the rate of infection (R) and the number of infections down,” the spokesman said. “This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we start to recover from coronavirus.” 
“Everyone has a role to play in keeping the rate of infection (R) down by staying alert and following the rules,” they added.

Government plans to boost levels of walking and cycling after the coronavirus crisis are under threat from a minority of objectors, whose views do not represent the opinions of many Britons, a pro-cycling campaign has claimed.  Research carried out for the  BikeIsBest  organisation found 77% of Britons would support changes in their local area to encourage more cycling and walking.    The figures, from a YouGov survey undertaken this week, found that more generally, 65% of people said they wanted streets redesigned to protect pedestrians and cyclists. It found 51% would cycle more if this happened, while 33% said they would drive less if street layouts were changed. 
Bike boom: UK sales up 60% in April as Covid-19 changes lifestyles  
Read more        Dozens of cities and other councils across the UK have introduced temporary schemes to try and encourage walking and cycling, after encouragement  from Downing Street and the Department for Transport  to help reduce motor traffic levels when fewer people can use public transport because of the coronavirus.  This has included pavements widened with barriers, temporary cycle lanes, and low-traffic zones in residential streets, with entrances partly blocked so pedestrians and cyclists can move freely, but motor vehicles cannot.  
The changes have led to some vocal protests, prompting some councils to back down. A  Guardian analysis  this month found six areas – Ealing, Wandsworth, South Gloucestershire, Trafford, Portsmouth and Surrey – where funded cycle routes had been cancelled.  This included the removal of a temporary cycle lane on Reigate High Street after just a few days, when the local Conservative MP, Crispin Blunt, lobbied Surrey county council.  Several subsequent schemes have faced intense protests from relatively small groups of residents and others, who have set up websites and energetic social media feeds seeking to argue the plans are not supported by locals.  But BikeIsBest – which is supported in part by companies in the cycle industry – said their polling showed such moves were generally popular, and that they believed something could be done about the perils of motor traffic.  It found, for example, that 65% of respondents believed children should be able to play in the street without the danger from  rat-running traffic , while 66% disagree with the idea that nothing can be done about the general danger from motor vehicles.  The campaign was commissioned by Dr Ian Walker, an environmental psychologist at the University of Bath and a leading researcher on attitudes to cycling, to analyse the polling.  “Perhaps one reason negative voices find it so easy to sway things their way is that people have a tendency to misjudge public levels of support,” he said. “The survey showed that, while most people think Britain would be a better place if more people cycled, they also guessed that other people were less supportive, and more hostile, to the idea than they were.”  BikeIsBest’s Adam Tranter said: “When 20mph streets were first proposed, pro-motoring groups were whipped up into a frenzy, just as they are today. In 2017, data showed that the proportion opposed or strongly opposed to residential 20mph limits was just 10%. The same is happening here with measures to enable more people to switch their journeys to cycling and walking.”

Closing summary: Markets hit by doses of bad news 
Finally, European stock markets have all closed lower tonight, as investors continue to worry about the scale of the Covid-19 lockdown.  
A late flurry of selling has sent all the indices deeper into the red, with the Stoxx 600 losing 1.3% today -- leaving it down 1.2% for the week. 
Here’s the damage: 
FTSE 100: down 75 points at 5752 
German DAX: down 177 points or 1.7% at 10,336 
French CAC: down 57 points or 1.3% at 4,393 
There are plenty of reasons for pessimism today, including that: 
UK retail sales fell at their fastest ever monthly pace in March  
German business confidence has hit a record low  
US durable goods orders have tanked, due to a slump in aircraft demand  
US consumer confidence has dropped sharply  
And with Gatwick airport warning that  travel won’t fully recover for four years , and boardroom pay cuts at Burberry and JD Sports, the crisis has a long way to run. 
Traders are also disappointed by the overnight news tha t Gilead’s Remdesiver drug did not perform well in its first trial  (although that test data did vanish as it’s not been fully reviewed yet, apparently). 
David Madden of CMC Markets  says Europe’s struggle to agree a rescue deal to combat the Covid-19 downturn is also weighing on markets: 
Stocks markets are in the red as traders are a little downbeat on account of the lack of progress in relation to an EU rescue package, as well as the disappointing results for a potential Covid-19 treatment. European leaders are divided about the size of the financial package. There are even deeper divisions over what portion of the scheme will be grants, and what portion will be loans. Broadly speaking, southern European economies are calling for grants, while the northern members are keen on loans. The lingering division is hanging over sentiment. 
Hopes for a potential Covid-19 treatment were running high this day last week, as Remdesivir, an antiviral drug produced by Gilead Sciences, was reported to have helped patients with fever and respiratory problems. Those hopes were dashed when a medical trial in China said the drug was unsuccessful. When it comes to the pharma industry, there is usually a lot of trial and error, so I doubt we have heard the last about a potential treatment for the coronavirus.  
Indeed. On that note, have a lovely weekend (don’t go too far!).  GW

Four more Debenhams stores won_t reopen after lockdown

In another example of retail gloom, Debenhams is to permanently close four more stores with the loss of 239 jobs after failing to reach agreements with landlords.  
It is understood that the stores in Swindon, Kidderminster, Borehamwood and Southampton, which were closed last month under the government’s coronavirus restrictions on non-essential retailers, will not reopen when the lockdown is eased. 
The department store, which  collapsed into administration  last week, has reached agreement on 120 sites which are expected to continue to operate the future of 11 more hang in the balance. 
It emerged last week that seven stores, including Salisbury, Westfield in west London, Leamington Spa, and South Shields, would permanently close after more than 20 closed in the previous few months. 
On Friday Mark Gifford, the new chairman of Debenhams, wrote to the Welsh government saying that the group’s stores in Wales were also at risk because the regional government has decided not to offer a business rates holiday on sites with a rateable value over £500,000. 
About half the group’s nine Welsh stores are thought to be in that bracket paying more than £2m a year total in rates between them.

Behind the charts, graphs and numbers which make up economic data are real stories of human misery.   
And that includes the sad news that more than 200 Oasis and Warehouse head office staff have been left struggling for cash after being laid off a fortnight before pay day. 
The design, buying and merchandising staff who had not been furloughed under the government job protection scheme and had been working on producing the two brands’ fashion collections for next year, have been told they will have to apply for government assistance to cover back pay owed as well as holiday pay and redundancy pay outs. 
Oasis and Warehouse last week called in administrators from advisory firm Deloitte after owner Kaupthing, the Iceland bank, failed to find a buyer for the retail businesses. More than 1,800 retail store staff have been put on furlough under the government’s job protection scheme but only about 40 head office staff remain in post. 
One former Warehouse staff member is worried about how she would pay her mortgage. She says: 
“I felt complete shock. We had no idea the company was in financial difficulties. We had hoped we might be furloughed. We’re all in a tricky situation. 
There are no jobs for us to go to and some people were on maternity leave or pregnant so they are really stuck.”

There’s time for some late pessimism too.  
Barclays has slashed its economic forecasts for the UK. It now expects the economy to shrink by 8% this year, which would be the worst recession in decades.  
More alarmingly, its economists reckon growth will only recover slowly, and that unemployment will soon hit 9% (from just 4% in the last quarter).  
A longer lock down, policy frictions and a less favourable global backdrop lead us to cut our forecasts for the UK. We now expect 2020 GDP to drop 8% and remain 4% below pre-virus trend by end 2021. We see unemployment peaking near 9% in Q2 20, the budget deficit ballooning to 10.8% of GDP and the debt-GDP ratio above 100%.

UK competition watchdog bares teeth over travel refunds

Back in the UK, the competition watchdog has warned it will set out measures to tackle concerns about refunds and cancellations in the travel industry after a surge in complaints.   
The Competition and Markets Authority said four in five complaints to its coronavirus taskforce related to refunds and cancellations. 
It said it was “particularly concerned” about firms refusing refunds and “introducing unnecessary complexity into the process of obtaining refunds; charging high administration or cancellation fees; and pressuring consumers into accepting vouchers instead of cash refunds.”

The largest price increases were on hand sanitiser, with an average 367% rise reported.

This is the worst slump in US durable goods orders since 2014.  
It’s mainly due to a huge drop in demand for civilian aircraft. 
According to Bloomberg, civilian aircraft maker recorded negative orders of $16.3 billion, a drop of around 300%. 
That, I think, means the number of cancelled orders far exceeded any new orders, as the airline industry grounds its fleets.

US durable goods orders slide 
Newsflash: Orders for US durable goods have tumbled sharply, adding to the growing chorus of grim economic news.  
Orders for heavy-duty machinery, electronics devices, transport equipment and the like fell by 14.4% in March, new figures from the Commerce Department show. 
That’s down from a 1.1% rise in February, and even worse than the 12% drop expected. 
Strip out defence orders, and it’s a 15.8% decline, showing a sharp drop in economic demand. 
It’s an early sign of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy. Falling orders ultimately mean lower production, so the knock-on impact will be felt in the coming months.

This welcome drop in volatility shows that investors have stopped panicking about the pandemic - but are now trying to assess how long it will last, and how quickly companiy earnings will recover. 
Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, says:   
The FTSE 100 is down 23.8% so far this year. Across the index, 41 stocks have managed to outperform the market, eight of whom have actually delivered positive returns this year. These include precious metals miner Polymetal up 42.7% and grocery expert Ocado up 26.5%.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought Britain to a near standstill, with road travel plummeting by as much as 73%, to levels not seen since 1955. 
All forms of travel have plunged in urban areas. Walking, cycling and car and van journeys are all down by about three-quarters, while bus numbers have fallen by 60%. The number of large lorries has declined by just 40% as essential supplies continue to be transported. 
However, national data from Monday and Tuesday, the two most recent days available, shows a slight upward trend since the previous week, with motor traffic down only 63%, equivalent to 1962. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, called the trend concerning. “Please follow medical and scientific advice to stay home and save lives,” he said. 
The empty streets have already resulted in  big drops in air pollution , which is likely to  reduce early deaths  from lung and heart conditions. Traffic deaths and injuries are near certain to have fallen, but data is not yet available. Noise pollution, which is also known to have adverse affects on human health, is down, and the quieter streets have encouraged  wildlife to venture  into some towns. 
updated traffic graphic 
Cabinet Office data shows motor traffic dropped by 73% on 29 March compared with pre-outbreak levels. Guardian analysis shows the number of road miles travelled has not been  this low since 1955 , when far fewer people owned cars and there were no motorways. The government data also shows rail travel down 90%, and tube and bus journeys in London down by 94% and 83% respectively. 
Some experts suggest that people who have learned how to work effectively from home may continue to do so for a day or two a week after the Covid-19 crisis is over. This could help tackle the climate emergency, because the transport sector is the biggest emitter and the only one to have  increased its emissions in recent years . Others, however, say emissions could rise again if the coronavirus lockdown causes lasting financial damage to public transport services. 
Detailed data from  Vivacity , a video analysis company, shows that pedestrian, bicycle and car journeys in urban areas started falling a few days after the government announced it was moving from the contain to the  delay phase of its pandemic response  on 12 March. Bus, van and large HGV trips started falling later, after Boris Johnson announced a national lockdown on 23 March. 
The data shows large HGV traffic actually rose significantly in the week before the lockdown. “We interpret that as, because people were suddenly panic buying, they needed to do many more deliveries to shops across the country,” Vivacity’s CEO, Mark Nicholson, said. 
Traffic fall after coronavirus outbreak 
Cyclist numbers fell more slowly than those for pedestrians, who often arrive in city centres on public transport. This may be because some people switched to cycling, either to avoid crowded buses and trains or because of sunny weather. 
Nicholson said people may continue to work from home at least some of the time in future. “If that manages to decrease traffic on the roads then that would be a great outcome from an environmental perspective,” he said. 
Vivacity’s data comes from its network of hundreds of cameras in urban areas across England, including Manchester, Liverpool, Nottingham, Oxford, Cambridge, Peterborough, Bournemouth and on the M32. Most cameras are on busy streets, so do not monitor traffic in residential areas. 
The company uses AI software installed in the cameras to analyse video footage of traffic, generating data that helps local authorities to plan traffic management. No images of faces are stored and numberplate data is erased every 24 hours. 
Claire Haigh, the CEO of Greener Journeys, said the big fall in revenue for public transport services might damage its viability in the longer term, with bus and coach travel already in decline before the virus struck as people shop more online. 

As people flock to beaches and parks this weekend after the hottest August day in 17 years, a leading health expert has warned that such heatwaves will become more regular – and highly dangerous – if nothing is done to curtail the climate emergency. 
Temperatures reached 36.4C (97.5F) in Heathrow and Kew Gardens on Friday, the highest on any day in this month since 2003, the Met Office said. The hot weather in some parts of the country is expected to give way to thunderstorms early next week. 
Ilan Kelman, a professor of disasters and health at University College London, warned that the sort of weather being seen in southern England, which poses a serious risk to vulnerable people, would become more regular unless action was taken. 
“These temperatures are unfortunately in line with the expectations for heat under climate change, which is one of the most concerning health impacts,” he said. 
“Without stopping human-caused climate change, these levels of summer heat and humidity will become regular, making it highly dangerous for us to be outdoors and even indoors without continual cooling. Air pollution can also worsen under heat with its knock-on health effects, such as for cancer and asthma. 
“Irrespective of urban heat islands and natural climate variabilities, the human signal in climate change is showing in these heat patterns.” 
HM Coastguard has reported a surge in the number of callouts on Friday as people flocked to beaches. About 70 incidents required a response in the morning, which the coastguard said was above average for this time of year, as beachgoers arrived as early as 9am. 
“The coast is very busy today and that’s grown across the morning and will continue to grow as the day goes on,” said Matt Leat, of HM Coastguard. He said he expected to see a similar number of incidents to Friday 31 July, which was the organisation’s busiest day in four years. 
“It’s highly possible some of the beaches are the busiest in a number of years,” he said, as the Coastguard warned people to be careful and avoid using inflatables in the water because they can be blown out to sea. 
There were also warnings to avoid some crowded beaches on the south coast. By Friday afternoon, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) council’s beach check app showed 19 of its 24 beaches under red alert, warning people to avoid the areas as safe social distancing is not possible. 
The remaining beaches were under amber alert, meaning they were congested and beachgoers should “stay alert”. 
Record heat in UK 
Daily weather is caused by the interaction of the strong global heating trend being driven by carbon emissions and local variability. The climate crisis has already made UK  heatwaves 30 times more likely  and extreme temperatures led to  3,400 early deaths between 2016-19 . 
The government’s official adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June that “the  UK is poorly prepared  for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”.

Recent research showed the likelihood of the UK experiencing  40C temperatures for the first time was “rapidly accelerating”  because of the climate emergency. Another  analysis indicated  that, even with some cuts in emissions, London would have the same climate by 2050 that Istanbul has today, Leeds would be like Melbourne, and Edinburgh like Paris. All three foreign cities have already broken 40C temperatures. 
“Climate change is exerting an increasing impact on the UK’s climate,” said Mike Kendon, lead author of a  Met Office climate report published last Friday . “Since 2002 we have seen the warmest 10 years in the series. By contrast, to find a year in the coldest 10 we have to go back to 1963 – over 50 years ago.” 
The coronavirus lockdowns across the world have led to sharp drops in carbon emissions, but this short-term action  would have “negligible” impact on the climate emergency , a study published on Friday found. 
However, the research also showed that putting the huge sums of post-Covid-19 government funding into a green recovery and shunning fossil fuels would give the world a good chance of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 1.5C. The scientists said we were now at a “make or break” moment for keeping below this limit, which was agreed by the world’s governments to avoid the worst impacts of global heating.

A wide range of business, economics, health and environmental groups are urging governments including the UK to  implement a green recovery . 
Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, a consultant in public health at Public  Health  England, said that while many people welcomed spells of warmer weather, others found it difficult to cope. She said those recovering from Covid-19 or self-isolating, as well older people and people with underlying health conditions, were particularly vulnerable. 
“If you need to provide care to someone at risk from hot weather, follow government guidance on how to do this safely. The most important advice is to ensure they stay hydrated, keep cool and know how to keep their homes cool.” 

Thunderstorms and torrential rain are forecast to sweep across the UK, bringing an end to a week of blazing sunshine and scorching temperatures.  The Met Office said storms could bring lightning, hail and flooding to some areas on Friday, with up to 50mm of rain falling in an hour.    
Quick Guide  How global heating is causing more extreme weather         Show   
Greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, forest destruction and other human activities are trapping heat and putting more energy into the climate system._  Hotter air means heatwaves are much more likely. For example, scientists now say the unprecedented heat and wildfires across the northern hemisphere in 2018 “ could not have occurred without human-induced climate change ”. In Australia, the scorching summer of 2016-17 in New South Wales was  made at least 50 times more likely by global heating , linking it directly to climate change.  Hotter air can also carry more water vapour, meaning more intense rain and more flooding._  Another important factor in the northern hemisphere is the impact of changes in the Arctic. The polar region is heating more rapidly, reducing the temperature difference with lower latitudes. There is  strong evidence that this is weakening the planetary waves  (including the jet stream) that normally meander over Europe, Asia and North America.  When these waves stall, weather gets fixed over regions and becomes extreme. This has been linked to past floods in Pakistan, heatwaves in Russia and drought in California._  Most of the planet’s trapped heat goes into the oceans and rising sea temperatures mean more energy for hurricanes and typhoons.  Record-breaking cyclones hit Mozambique _last year. The deluge delivered in the US by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 was made  three times more likely by climate change . Rising sea level also means storms cause more coastal damage.  Natural variability would cause some extreme weather, even without global heating, but our impacts on the climate make such extremes more likely.  Carbon Brief analysed more than 230 studies  and found 95% of heatwaves were made more likely or worse by climate change. For droughts, 65% were definitely affected by our hotter world, while the figure for floods was 57%. With the  ‘rapidly accelerating’ likelihood of 40C temperatures in UK , it is now undeniable that global heating is causing more extreme weather.

Thank you for your feedback.      A yellow weather warning was issued for most of England,  Scotland  and east Wales from midday to 9am on Saturday. The south-west and parts of the south-east coast of England were not included in the warning.  The Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell said: “Not everyone will see a storm, but if you catch one, you will certainly know about it.”  The change in weather comes after the UK experienced its hottest day of the year so far on Thursday, when the mercury rose to 33.4C (92.1F) at Heathrow airport in west London.  Thousands of people flocked to the south coast, resulting in a major incident being declared and government experts warning people against gathering in large groups.  Scotland and  Wales  also had their hottest days of the year so far, with the former recording 30.8C in Prestwick and the latter peaking at 31.4C in Trawsgoed, near Aberystwyth.  Temperatures on Friday were forecast to reach 31C in London, the mid-20s for the rest of England and up to 27C in the Highlands, making for a relatively warm and humid day, Snell said.

Photograph: Stephen Pond/Getty Images   The storms were expected to clear north-eastwards in the afternoon and evening but would linger over north-east Scotland until Saturday morning.  On Friday morning, the Environment Agency issued seven flood alerts, indicating flooding was possible, of which five were near rivers in the West Midlands, while others centred on the waterways around Loughborough, in Leicestershire, and the River Trent tributaries in Nottinghamshire.  Temperatures were expected to drop on Saturday to 22-23C in London and stay around the high teens to low 20s in the rest of the UK.  Snell said: “The weather will change but it will be more what people expect our summer to be like: a mix of sun and showers.”  On Thursday, Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council  declared a major incident  after services were overstretched when huge numbers of visitors defied advice to stay away from its beaches.  
01:16           Huge crowds on England's south coast as people flock to beaches - video     Condemning the “irresponsible” behaviour of crowds who gridlocked roads, dumped rubbish and parked illegally, the council said extra police patrols had been brought in.  The local MP, Tobias Ellwood, told BBC Breakfast: “This place was deluged and social distancing went out the window and that’s why a major incident was declared, because the local authority and indeed the police couldn’t cope.  “The beach should have been closed down … to prevent further people from entering it.”  The public has been advised to avoid cooling off in open water, after the deaths of two people in Berkshire and Scotland.  A 10-year-old boy died after getting into difficulty in Loch Lubnaig, near Callander, in the Highlands, on Wednesday evening, Police Scotland said. Meanwhile, a body was found during the search for a missing man at Lulle Brook in Cookham, Berkshire.  Eyad al-Ryabi, a Syrian refugee, had gone into the water on Tuesday evening to help a friend, his cousin said. The friend survived and was taken to hospital in a serious condition, Thames Valley police said.

Its president, Edmund King, said: “With the combination of the severe heat, cars that have been in lockdown and millions of vehicles that have delayed their MoTs, the AA has seen more breakdowns.”   

People in the UK have flocked to beaches with temperatures approaching 36C on Saturday as the mini-heatwave continues.  Friday was the  hottest August day in 17 years , with 36.4C recorded at Heathrow and Kew Gardens in London, and temperatures are expected to remain high until the middle of next week.    The Met Office said temperatures reached 34.5C at Frittenden in Kent on Saturday, and that although there was some cloud south-east England could again peak at 36C.  Crowds of people headed for the coast, with images showing packed beaches, traffic jams and full car parks. Much of Bournemouth’s coast was deemed unsafe on Saturday by the local authority and people were told to avoid 19 of its 24 beaches because “safe social distancing is not possible”.  Some beachgoers complained about larger groups arriving later in the day and not respecting physical distancing, but others were unconcerned. Brighton beach was seen packed with sunseekers and many were also pictured in Weymouth, Anglesea, Lyme Regis and elsewhere. In Sussex, police turned away cars from the beach area as the car park was full by 10am.

Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA   Parts of the UK could have record overnight temperatures this weekend, with London and the south-east experiencing unusually hot weather over the past few days.  The Met Office has said more records may be matched or broken in the coming days with some extremely hot and sticky nights on the way. Temperatures in parts of south-east England will remain above 20C, potentially reaching the overnight record of 23.9C set in Brighton on 3 August 1990.  The Met Office has issued a level-three health warning for the south and south-east, meaning the public should look out for others, particularly children, older people and those in poor health.  Ishani Kar-Purkayastha, a Public Health England consultant, said: “This summer, many of us are spending more time at home due to Covid-19. A lot of homes can overheat, so it’s important we continue to check on older people and those with underlying health conditions, particularly if they’re living alone and may be socially isolated.”  Dan Harris, the Met Office’s deputy chief meteorologist, also said, however, that thunderstorms were on the way and that some places may receive up to 80mm of rain in a few hours.  “We’ve issued a broad thunderstorm warning for Monday and Tuesday for all parts of the UK, since although the ingredients are there, it’s just too early to pinpoint the details of exactly where and when thunderstorms will occur,” he said.  “As such, we will be monitoring the developing signals closely and I urge people to keep a close eye on Met Office warnings and forecasts over the coming days.”  The climate crisis has made UK  heatwaves 30 times more likely  and extreme temperatures led to  3,400 early deaths between 2016-19 .  The government’s official advisory body, the Committee on Climate Change, said on 25 June that “the  UK is poorly prepared  for the very serious impacts of climate change, including … overheating”.  The hottest August day on record is 38.5C, recorded in Faversham on 10 August 2003. The UK’s highest temperature, of 38.7C, was recorded at Cambridge Botanic Garden on 25 July last year.  South East Water warned that people could be without tap water unless usage was cut as it called on people to “put away the hose pipes, garden sprinklers and garden water toys” to ensure there was enough for everyone to drink.

The Met Office said a deep area of low pressure was crossing the UK, bringing gusts of up to 70mph in exposed western locations and also heavy rain for many. 
It said: “A yellow wind warning is in force for the whole of Wales and most of England until midday on Wednesday. While not exceptional, winds this strong are unusual for August and they will be accompanied by some heavy rain in places, with possible transport disruption and impacts on outdoor activities. 
“Large waves are also expected in coastal areas around the south-west including the Bristol Channel throughout Tuesday, moving along the English Channel as the day progresses. Beachgoers are advised to take extra care. 
“The rain is expected to be heaviest in Northern Ireland and south-west Scotland where 60-90mm in total could fall as the storm moves from west to east. Storm Francis is due to clear to the east of the UK by Wednesday lunchtime.” 
The Met Office chief meteorologist, Andy Page, said: “The UK is in for another unseasonably wet and windy spell with Storm Francis arriving. There will be strong winds and heavy rain, especially in the west of the UK.”

The poor weather may mean no play is possible on the last day of the final cricket Test match between England and Pakistan in Southampton.  The England fast bowler James Anderson is hoping the rain will pass and give him the chance to take his 600th Test wicket.  
The Met Office has not had two named storms in August since the process started in 2015, but Francis follows Ellen, which struck last week. 
No new storm is currently forecast this month, meaning the next one will begin with A rather than G, as the storm-naming calendar resets on 1 September. 

Thunderstorm warnings are still in place for most of the UK on Wednesday, while high temperatures are forecast again for many parts of England.  The Met Office has issued a yellow storm warning for all of England and the eastern half of Scotland, and a more serious amber warning for eastern Scotland between Edinburgh, Inverness and Aberdeen.    An amber warning means people should be on alert for flash flooding and building damage from lightning strikes, floodwaters and hailstones. Delays to public transport, difficult driving conditions and possible road closures could also follow, and deep and fast-flowing floodwater could be a threat to human life.  Under its yellow warning, the Met Office is predicting storms for north-west England, north Wales and the West Midlands in particular on Wednesday and Thursday.  Chief meteorologist Steve Ramsdale said in these areas “exceptional rainfall totals could be seen of 60 millimetres in an hour with a very small chance of 150 millimetres of rainfall in three or four hours”.  The Environment Agency has five flood alerts posted for possible flooding in areas around Birmingham, and 17 flood alerts are in place across Scotland.  Heatwave conditions are forecast to continue in many parts of England, with a top temperature of 31C expected in London, Cambridge, Yeovil and Southampton.  It will also be warm further north, where Leeds, Sheffield and Nottingham are expecting 30C, as are Birmingham and Cardiff.  Ten properties in Lancashire were affected by flooding on Tuesday following overnight storms, the Environment Agency said.  The rainfall caused the Burrow Beck waterway in Scotforth, south Lancaster, to rise by almost a metre in less than three hours, the agency’s flood risk manager, Andy Brown, said.  The agency said further heavy showers could cause more flooding in mostly urban areas of England until Friday, with some homes being affected.   

Gale-force winds of up to 61mph have battered the south-west of England as Storm Alex moved in from France.  The storm had pushed strong winds and rain into southern England, disrupting travel and power lines in the south-west and the Isle of Wight.    The breakdown cover provider Green Flag has forecast nine breakdowns a minute on UK roads between Friday and Monday. Mark Newberry, the commercial director at Green Flag, said he expected the most callouts on Saturday, with a 10% increase in breakdowns compared with usual.  “As a result of these weather conditions, we urge drivers to remain cautious and to carry out the relevant safety checks before leaving to make their journeys,” he said.  Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks recorded unplanned outages in more than 20 areas, including Portsmouth, Southampton and towns east of Reading, according to the customer interactive map.  
People take pictures of the waves hitting the harbour wall in Folkestone, Kent.  Photograph: Gareth Fuller/PA   The company said, however, this was normal, rating the shortage as “low incidence” The cuts were concentrated to small areas, it added, with power lines generally holding up well.  Western Power Distribution also recorded incidents in south-west England, affecting Devon, Cornwall, Dorset and Somerset.  A Met Office spokeswoman, Nicola Maxey, said the highest wind speeds of 61mph hit Berry Head in Devon and the Isle of Wight on Friday morning, making power lines susceptible to damage.  Power cuts were more likely in early autumn because trees still had their leaves, she said, which meant branches were more likely to fall in high winds and disrupt cables.  Maxey said the wet and windy weather would move up from south-west England and Wales towards the north of England,  Northern Ireland  and Scotland throughout Friday afternoon – though the rain was expected to become lighter.  Amber weather warnings for the heaviest rainfall likely to cause transport disruption were in place for parts of  Wales , the West Midlands and south-west England until 6pm on Sunday.  
Large waves crash over the seawall in Brixham, Devon.  Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters   Gale-force gusts brought by Storm Alex were expected to subside by the end of Friday, but yellow warnings for rain will remain in place for most of the UK over the weekend.  Maxey said: “A second rain front is coming to replace Storm Alex over the weekend, pushing in from the east on Saturday morning and affecting western areas later on. The rain is slowly pushing north but it will be relieved as it goes.  “On Saturday, most of the country will be affected by rain, and it’s looking heaviest in the centre, down the spine of the country from Aberdeen to Bristol.”  Autumnal temperatures of 10-15C are expected over the weekend, with the coolest temperatures expected in  Scotland .   

Britain has been  basking in sunshine on the hottest day of the year so far , the Met Office has confirmed, as the temperature peaked at 32.6C (90.6F) on Wednesday.  That high was recorded in Heathrow, west London, and the mercury was forecast to hit 33C in other parts of the UK, although it remained cooler in northern Scotland.    The Met Office said temperatures were unlikely to fall any lower than the high teens overnight and could rise to 34C in the south of England on Thursday.  The heatwave, which began on Tuesday and has led to much of the country sweltering in temperatures averaging in the high 20s or low 30s, is expected to continue until Friday. Weather warnings for thunderstorms across much of the UK have been issued for Friday and Saturday.  Many people have been flocking to parks and the seaside this week, with the beach in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, just one of many packed with sunbathers and swimmers.  The Met Office’s chief meteorologist, Dan Suri, said: “We quite often see warm southerly air from the continent bringing these high temperatures to the UK in summer, however this week the air across the UK has arrived from the Atlantic.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images   “This Atlantic air will descend and warm up as it moves across the UK and this, in combination with clear skies and strong late-June sunshine, is why we are seeing temperatures rise.”  The highest UK temperature recorded in June was 35.6C, set at Mayflower Park in Southampton, on 28 June 1976.  While many have been enjoying the sunshine this week, others will be alarmed at the soaring temperatures amid reports of global heating in other parts of the world.  The Met Office said  parts of northern Eurasia had been experiencing extremely high temperatures this year  because of a combination of climate change and extreme climate variability.  In May, surface temperatures in parts of Siberia were 10C above average amid a prolonged heatwave that climate scientists described as “undoubtedly alarming”.  The Russian town of Khatanga, which usually has daytime temperatures of about 0C at this time of year,  hit 25C on 22 May .  There has been speculation that  2020 could become the hottest year on record , but Prof Adam Scaife, the head of the Met Office’s long-range prediction, said that was unlikely. “We are likely to have seen the most extreme global temperatures already this year,” he said.   

A man has been killed after a tree fell on to his car during Storm Ciara, police said on Monday.  The 58-year-old was travelling on the A33 between Winchester and Micheldever village seven miles north of the city when the tree struck his Mercedes on Sunday afternoon.    Police closed the road for several hours while emergency services were there. The man, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene.  The news came as it emerged that 500 homes and about 400 businesses had been flooded in the Calder Valley. More than 20,000 homes lost power across the country as the UK continued to reel from the storm.  Referring to the Boxing Day floods of just over four years ago, local Labour MP Holly Lynch said there was a “sense of absolute devastation” that “for so many residents we are in the same position again having flooded in 2015”.  Philip Davies, MP for neighbouring Shipley, said it was “completely unacceptable” that many constituents flooded during Storm Ciara were also victims of the 2015 floods.  Their remarks came as the environment secretary, Theresa Villiers, made a statement in the Commons on the government’s response to flooding over the weekend.  Villiers said river levels in West Yorkshire and Lancashire were receding, before warning: “We must expect high river levels further down the stream in South Yorkshire over the next few days.”  She also confirmed the government had activated the emergency Bellwin scheme for areas in the north of England affected by Storm Ciara.  The scheme – activated for qualifying areas in West Yorkshire, Cumbria and Lancashire – enables local authorities dealing with the storm to apply to have all of the eligible costs they incur, above a threshold, to be reimbursed by the government.

Homes were evacuated in Essex after a car fell into a huge sinkhole caused by the storm. Pictures from the scene showed the Toyota trapped nose-first in the sinkhole on a residential road in Brentwood, with the driver and passenger doors wide open and both airbags inflated.  It is believed that the car was being driven on the road when the sinkhole opened up, although the driver is said to have escaped uninjured.

Six properties were evacuated in the early hours of the morning due to unstable ground.  Parts of the UK were hit by blizzards and up to 20cm of snow, with travel disruption expected to continue.  Some areas had a month and a half’s rainfall in 24 hours as gusts of more than 90mph swept the country on Sunday, with 178 flood warnings in place.  Flights, ferries and trains were cancelled or delayed and drivers faced difficult conditions as flood water, fallen trees and other debris closed roads.  A Met Office amber weather warning for wind, which had been in place across most of England, elapsed at 9pm on Sunday as Storm Ciara moved to the north-east of  Scotland .

Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty   A yellow warning for heavy snow and strong winds was in place for  Northern Ireland  and most of Scotland, and a yellow warning of snow and ice was in force for north-west England throughout Monday and Tuesday. A yellow warning for wind in the south was issued for between 10am and 5pm on Monday.  The Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: “While Storm Ciara is clearing away that doesn’t mean we’re entering a quieter period of weather. It’s going to stay very unsettled.  “We have got colder air coming through the UK and we will be feeling a real drop in temperatures, with an increased risk of snow in northern parts of the UK and likely in Scotland.  “There could be up to 20cm on Monday and Tuesday and, with strong winds, blizzards aren’t out of the question.”

The River Irwell burst its banks at Radcliffe in Greater Manchester, while areas including Blackpool, Whalley, Longton and Rossendale were affected by flooding in Lancashire.   

A 30-year-old man who lured a vulnerable teenager to woodland where he murdered her and defiled her body has been jailed for a minimum of 25 years.  Shane Mays walked with Louise Smith, 16, to a secluded spot in Hampshire before repeatedly punching her in the face, causing fatal injuries.    Her body was subjected to what the prosecution called “extreme violence and violation” before being burned. Louise’s remains were found 13 days later following a police search.  Louise had moved in with Mays and his wife, Chazlynn Jayne Mays, Louise’s aunt, shortly before the attack after the girl quarrelled with her mother.  But arguments broke out between the three and Louise, who was training to be a veterinary nurse, complained that Mays would “flirt” with her and pin her down, and the court was shown a Snapchat video of him tickling her feet.  Sentencing Mays, from Havant, Hampshire, to life imprisonment, Mrs Justice May said she could not be certain the murder was “sexual or sadistic” but described it as “grotesque”.  
Louise Smith.  Photograph: PA   The judge said Louise was suffering from anxiety and depression and had a social worker.  She told Winchester crown court she was sentencing Mays based on the fact he had a “father-daughter” relationship with Louise. “He committed the most grotesque abuse of trust,” she said.  Hampshire county council has announced a learning review of the case. A spokesperson said: “All the evidence heard in court will be considered alongside all other relevant information from the council and other agencies by the Hampshire safeguarding children partnership in its learning review.”  Addressing Mays in a victim impact statement, Louise’s mother, Rebecca Cooper, said: “You have taken a part of my heart away which will never be replaced. You killed my daughter Louise in such a traumatic way but then to do what you did afterwards is beyond words.  “You are a monster. What gave you the right to do that? You damaged her so bad that I didn’t have a chance to say goodbye, hold her hand or even kiss her. I will never forgive you for this.”  Louise’s father, Bradley Smith, said he was “tortured by nightmares”, and added: “Louise was a beautiful daughter and I have been robbed of what was to be my time with her.”  Mays told the court he punched Louise in the face “many” times and heard her bones crack after losing his temper. He said: “I just carried on, I lost control of myself. She made a moaning noise, that’s when I stopped.”  Andrew Langdon QC, representing Mays, said the defendant had been assessed as having learning difficulties and a personality disorder.   

Cash payments on all UK buses should be abolished for the duration of the coronavirus crisis to reduce the risk of driver infection, the union representing bus workers has demanded.  Unite called on Wednesday for an end to cash payments on all the bus systems still operating across the UK to help drive down infection rates, particularly as the country enters the predicted peak period of the outbreak over Easter and beyond.    In  Northern Ireland , Translink, the only state-owned public transport company left in the UK, announced it would no longer accept cash payments to protect staff and commuters from the virus. Translink also confirmed that all local NHS staff would travel free on its bus fleet.  Almost all parts of the UK outside of Unite’s London and Eastern region, which covers the capital and the areas east of it across to the coast, operate some form of cash payment on their buses.  Bobby Morton, the union’s national officer for passenger transport, said suspending all cash payments would be one of the most practical ways bus companies and the Department for  Transport  would reduce infection among his members.  He said: “We have asked the bus companies’ representative body to stop cash payments during the crisis. We have also lobbied them to raise this in a meeting with the Department for Transport on Wednesday.  “This one single move would not only reduce the risk of infection for our drivers but also give them some peace of mind. Because many of them tell their union that they are worried that they could also in turn infect their families when they come off shift.”  Within the bus system, those at the sharp end have relayed a mixed picture regarding access to personal protective hygiene measures, public behaviour and bus companies’ responses to Unite’s concerns.  Unite’s representatives in Northern Ireland and Wales said they were generally pleased with the response of the companies running bus routes.  However, as Unite and other transport unions mourn the loss of 14 bus workers who have died from Covid-19 since the lockdown, individual drivers have contacted the Guardian raising concerns in areas outside London over access to protective equipment and hygiene products.

Terms and conditions          One bus driver in the south-east who did not want to be identified said: “I have had to buy my own sanitising wipes and hand gel because management never offered any. In fact, when our union reps first asked for hand gel to be provided during a meeting with managers at the start of the lockdown one of them asked the shop stewards, ‘Won’t the gel pose a danger because a drive with it on his or her hands would make the steering wheel slippy?’ That is what we are up against.”  Another driver on a south-east England bus network said: “Some of the passengers are definitely better protected than we are. Some of them have masks which we don’t have.  “Yesterday I drove a bus with a security screen where the holes had been clingfilmed over! I think it was probably a driver rather than a management rule being implemented.”   

It’s the buzz he gets from reuniting the cyclists of  Cambridge  with their stolen bikes that has turned Omar Terywall into a self-proclaimed “vigilante”. He said: “You get really hooked on it when you start seeing major progress – and, well, it’s just nice helping people really, isn’t it?”  Like others across the country, from Portsmouth to Glasgow, Terywall runs a local  Facebook group  where Cambridge cyclists share details of their stolen bikes in the hope they will be spotted. Well-regarded by local police, Terywall happily spends hours each day hunting down stolen bikes via online advertisements and local tip-offs.    “I would think in the last year we’ve helped well in excess of 50 people get their bikes back,” he said.  Across the UK, bike theft is on the rise, according to  BikeRegister , a national cycle database, which helps police to identify stolen bikes.  Its figures suggest  the easing of lockdown in June coincided with a huge spike in bike crime that continued throughout the summer, as people sought to avoid public transport and  demand for bikes increased . In August alone, the database registered 932 thefts, a rise of 59% on last year’s figures.  But at the same time, BikeRegister is also receiving more reports of people getting their stolen bikes back via  Facebook  groups. “I’m not surprised these groups are being formed – I think cyclists are completely fed up,” said managing director James Brown. “Generally, with most police forces, cycle theft doesn’t get to the top of their list of priorities. But organised criminal gangs are making a lot of money from stealing bikes.”  In Cambridge, where bicycle theft is the number one reported crime, more than 4,500 people have joined Terywall’s group. Whenever someone posts about a bike theft, other members will start keeping an eye out around the town for the bike. “It’s working,” Terywall said. “People are actively looking out for stolen bikes. They read other people’s posts and get drawn in because they want to help.”  
Bikes outside the University in Cambridge, where bicycle theft is the number one reported crime.  Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters   Around 4,000 bikes are typically reported stolen in Cambridge each year, but just 70 people have been arrested for bike theft so far in 2020. On average, more than 90% of cycle theft investigations are closed by the police before a suspect has been identified. Often, therefore, when someone in Cambridge identifies that a stolen bike is being sold online, the owner will turn to Terywall for help. He will then pose as a buyer and confront the seller face-to-face about the theft, while filming their reaction with his mobile phone and warning them it is being streamed live to his Facebook group. “In every case so far, the seller has just accepted defeat, handed the bike over, and gone off.”  Cambridgeshire police superintendent James Sutherland said meeting up with sellers like this always risks a confrontation. But he doesn’t see Terywall or the members of his group as vigilantes. “I think they are very well-intentioned, motivated citizens who are quite rightly frustrated and angry about an endemic crime,” he said. “[However] I think there are risks attached to what they are doing.”  In Bristol, John Kelly helps to run a  similar stolen bikes Facebook group  with 2,000 members, which he says was started “out of frustration at the amount of bike theft going on” locally and a lack of police action. “We’re just a group of helpful like-minded individuals who want to keep hold of our bikes and help others do the same.”  There are two main ways members succeed at getting bikes back once they have been stolen, he says. One method involves an owner posing as a buyer, taking the bike for a “test cycle” and “stealing” the bike back. “Another member has a tactic that involves pushing the thief off the bike and taking it from them... We’d advise the first method if possible.”   Inspector Steve Davey of Avon and Somerset police said he would always advise victims of theft not to take action themselves against any person they believe is responsible for stealing their property. “Not only are they placing themselves at risk, but taking matters into their own hands could be detrimental to any police investigation and may prevent us from bringing offenders to justice.” 
Back in the saddle: Britain_s new love affair with cycling  
Read more        Terywall strongly recommends cyclists make a note of the frame numbers of their bikes; there is little the police can do to return a bike if an owner cannot provide firm evidence that identifies it as theirs.  “If we are actually going to be taking property from somebody, we have to have a solid base of evidence [that it’s stolen]. Somebody’s belief or intuition that the bike is theirs isn’t enough,” said Sutherland. “We cannot operate in the same way as online groups of activists – we have rules and procedures which govern us. And we can’t ask people to go and do things on our behalf either, to circumnavigate the rules. So it’s really about finding a balance: accepting that these [Facebook] groups exist and then working out how we, as a police service, work well with them.”  Although he wants to encourage local residents to report cycle crime whenever it occurs, he points out that police resources are limited, and other crimes are more serious, risky and harmful. “It’s always about striking a balance with the resources we’ve got.”      

We asked readers what they wanted to know about coronavirus and health.  Haroon Siddique , a reporter on our health team, has the answers.  Can you get coronavirus twice?          
Can you contract Covid-19 twice, and if so are symptoms likely to be milder if you do?  Rhonda Baker, IT worker, Colchester  
You can contract coronavirus twice, although  the number of confirmed instances of people who have done so worldwide  is very small. As to the likely severity on the second occasion, no consistent pattern has been identified. While the first person known to have contracted the virus twice –  a 33-year-old man from Hong Kong  – was asymptomatic the second time, doctors in the US reported that a 25-year-old man from Reno, Nevada, had been admitted to hospital with a Covid-19 reinfection after shrugging off an earlier brush with the disease. In most cases, the infection has been no worse the second time round, but there have been other instances – in the Netherlands, Ecuador and India – where, like in Nevada, it was more severe.  Is it safe to wear a visor instead of a mask?        
Can you wear a visor instead of a mask?  John, retired health and safety adviser, Kent   
Although  the guidance for England  does not specifically mention visors/shields, the Department of Health and Social Care confirmed that they do not qualify as face coverings and can only be worn in addition to a mask, not instead of it. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations explicitly state that visors/shields are not considered face coverings as they do not provide adequate protection alone. Modelling in Japan found that  plastic face shields were almost totally ineffective  at trapping respiratory aerosols.  How does the UK daily coronavirus hospitalisation rate compare with all daily hospitalisations?        
How does the daily hospitalisation infection rate compare with, say, road traffic injuries, prostate/breast cancer, heart attacks and flu? What is the daily death rate of all?  Rich Wardman, retired, Suffolk  
According to the latest  Office for National Statistics monthly mortality figures , coronavirus did not feature in the top 10 leading causes of death for deaths registered in September 2020 in England or Wales; in England, it was the 19th most common cause of death and in Wales it was the 24th most common cause of death​. However, September was a month in which the number of Covid deaths was relatively low. The latest figures published by UK statistics agencies for deaths where Covid-19 has been mentioned on the death certificate, combined with additional data on deaths that have occurred in recent days, show the number of deaths from coronavirus so far to be about 63,000. By comparison there were 66,424 deaths last year from dementia and Alzheimer’s – which made it the leading cause of death in England and Wales, behind 12.5% of deaths.  Separately,  the ONS found  that there were 48,168 deaths due to coronavirus in England and Wales in the first eight months of the year, compared with 13,619 due to pneumonia and 394 due to influenza. Last year, there were 1,870  reported  road deaths in the Great Britain, 27,820 people killed or seriously injured on public roads, and 157,630 road casualties of all severities. It is important to note that unlike other common causes of death such as dementia, cancer and heart disease, which are not infectious diseases, the spread of Covid can be curbed by measures such as social distancing and wearing face masks.  How many cases of coronavirus have been caused by touching contaminated surfaces?        
Put another way, should I still be washing my wrapped in plastic, tinned or bottled deliveries with bleach or detergent?  Geoff, potter, Rutland   
The World Health Organization has warned about surfaces being a source of transmission,  while conceding there are no reports demonstrating infection in this way . It said: “Despite consistent evidence as to Sars-CoV-2 contamination of surfaces and the survival of the virus on certain surfaces, there are no specific reports which have directly demonstrated fomite transmission. People who come into contact with potentially infectious surfaces often also have close contact with the infectious person, making the distinction between respiratory droplet and fomite transmission difficult to discern.” Some suggest that  surface transmission has been overplayed  as a cause of infection at the expense of warning about airborne transmission.  However, as the WHO says, it is difficult to isolate the risk that surface transmission poses. At any rate, washing deliveries is deemed unnecessary by  the Food Standards Agency, which says  Covid “is not known to be transmitted by exposure to food or food packaging” and says the risk is “very low”. It says staff handling food in shops and other food businesses are required to take precautions and emphasises the importance for consumers to do so too, by regularly washing hands with soap and water.  What’s the correct data for new coronavirus cases linked to different settings?        
What percentage of new cases are linked to different settings (households, bars, pubs, restaurants etc) and for each geographical area? Is there somewhere the public can find out this information as, for example, I’ve seen one report that says 30% are linked to pubs/restaurants but another that says it’s just 5.6%.    Jay, admin assistant, Southampton  
Robust data on settings is not available. Test-and-trace reports do not contain this data.  Public Health England (PHE) publishes weekly figures  on where acute respiratory infection (ARI) outbreaks or infections – including but not limited to Covid – are occurring, although they are heavily caveated. PHE says it depends on “the propensity [of different settings] to report incidents to PHE. Therefore these data are more useful for monitoring trends over time than making comparisons across setting categories.” And, of course, where institutions in a particular category have been closed in parts of the country, it will reduce the incidence of infections. The latest weekly figures by PHE (which also break down the data regionally) for the UK, excluding Wales, show 282 ARI incidents from care homes with at least one linked case that tested positive for Covid.

Read more        By contrast, for workplace settings the equivalent figure was 228 and for educational settings it was 234. The number for hospitals was 59 and for food outlet/restaurant settings it was 23. There is no separate category for pubs. (For other settings the number was 153.) PHE also notes that recently launched national school and university helplines are likely to have had an impact on the number of outbreaks being reported to health protection teams in those settings.  What’s happened to the Nightingale hospitals?        
What are the Nightingale hospitals being used for, if anything?  Sally Cheseldine, retired clinical psychologist, Edinburgh  
Last month, as figures showed there were more coronavirus patients in hospital than when the UK went into lockdown in March,  NHS  England’s medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: “We have asked the Nightingale hospitals in Manchester, Sunderland and Harrogate to prepare for this next phase. They are being asked to mobilise over the next few weeks ready to accept patients if necessary.” However, they do not appear to have treated any patients to date in the second wave.  Some of the seven Nightingale hospitals  did not treat a single patient  in the first wave. It might appear strange they are not being used given the current level of demand on the NHS, but staffing issues are relevant as personnel will have to be diverted from other hospitals, which are under pressure to reduce the backlog of patients on their waiting lists. On Wednesday, the head of NHS England, Sir Simon Stevens, said the Nightingales would be used as mass vaccination centres.

H   alf a century ago, on 4 March 1970, an  unexpected blizzard  dumped more than  25cm of snow  across central and south-east England overnight. Temperatures hovered around freezing and the snow settled, closing roads and airports. Morning trains from the Midlands arrived in London eight hours late.   The problem was the lack of warning. The Met Office did not start issuing snow alerts until the early hours, and most people were caught unprepared. While winter storms can be forecast, determining whether they will bring rain or snow  requires precise modelling . A slight change in temperature can have a big impact on what form the precipitation takes.     Questions were asked  in parliament about the snowfall. John Ellis, for the governing Labour party, was optimistic that the Met Office’s powerful new IBM computer might help predict such events in future.  The Conservative MP Nigel Birch was dismissive: “He [Ellis] said that he wanted to know when the weather was about to be out of the ordinary. My experience of British weather is that it is always out of the ordinary, and it will take more than a dozen computers to alter that.”  However, as the last 50 years have shown, better computers do improve weather forecasting, and we are now less likely to be surprised by unseasonal blizzards.   

Three children required surgery for “potentially life-changing injuries” after a double-decker school bus crashed into a railway bridge. 
The top of the bus was ripped off almost completely when the vehicle hit the bridge in Wellhouse Lane, Winchester, on Thursday. 
The bus had been taking children aged 11 to 16 to Henry Beaufort school when the accident occurred. A Hampshire police spokesman said: “Three children received potentially life-changing injuries that required surgery.” 
Another 12 children were treated for minor injuries at the scene and 57 were unhurt. 
DC Cate Paling, senior investigating officer, said: “This was a serious collision and our investigation will look to identify the exact circumstances. We have been working closely with the school and Hampshire county council to provide support to the students and their parents. We thank everyone for their cooperation. We ask members of the public not to speculate about the incident on social media.” 
Graphic 
Police are seeking the driver of a car that passed the bus shortly before the accident, which happened at 8.10am. 
The force spokesman said: “We believe the car is a blue Ford Focus, registration ending HPX, with a roof rack and cycle carrier. The driver may have information that could help our investigation. The serious collision investigation unit is also seeking information from anyone who saw the bus on its journey from Itchen Abbas through Easton and Kingsworthy.” 

A woman has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a newborn baby boy was found dead in woodland in Hampshire. The 36-year-old woman remains in police custody. 
The baby’s body was discovered near Shore Road in Hythe, near Southampton, just after 2pm on Thursday. 
DCI Liz Williams of Hampshire police said: “This is a difficult and complex investigation, and we have a dedicated team working hard to establish the exact circumstances of what took place. 
“Our officers are carrying out house-to-house inquiries in the area, so, if you do have any concerns, then please speak to them. If you do have information that you think could help our inquiries, then please come forward and speak to us.” 
Police had previously appealed for the mother of the baby to come forward. Detectives also asked for anyone with CCTV or dashcam footage from Shore Road or Frost Lane and the surrounding area to get in touch. 
Anyone with information should call 101, quoting either Operation Verse or the reference number 44200084127, or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
